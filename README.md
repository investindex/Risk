# Thinking about risk

“How much of my money should I invest?” is a question that cannot be avoided — to invest none of it is a tacit decision. And how should it be invested? Any good answer would be highly personalized, but the right information about risk can help anyone think about these questions.

In the context of investment, one can consider risk of loss on a spectrum: some securities can safely be considered to carry no risk, like [certificates of deposit](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/certificateofdeposit.asp) and [US treasury bills](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/treasurybill.asp); some have moderate risk, such as diversified index funds; and others carry high risk, such as [hedge fund purchases of distressed debt](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/bonds/08/distressed-debt-hedge-fund.asp). The lowest-risk options generate small returns and, in the current low-interest environment, will not even keep pace with inflation. Stock market index funds require the investor to accept meaningful risk, with the potential for much greater reward.

What do lifetime returns from index funds look like? According to [this article](https://www.wsj.com/articles/lessons-from-a-crazy-year-in-financial-markets-11609410602), placing $10,000 in an S&P 500 index fund in Jan 1980 with dividend reinvestments would have yielded nearly $700,000 of growth by August 2020. This is an impressive reward for leaving money alone, especially in contrast to any low-risk alternative. The average annual appreciation was just over 11%. Now imagine a different scenario, in which you added savings to a [tax-advantaged retirement account](https://github.com/investindex/Guidelines#tax-advantaged-accounts) at the beginning of every year. You started with $1,000 in 1980 and increased by $100 each year through 2020. For simplicity, imagine that your investment grew at the average rate the whole time. By the end of August 2020 you contributed $123,000 but your account reached a value of about $1.3 million. These examples are simplistic but exhibit the power of compounding growth.

</p>

Keep in mind that between 1980 and 2020, the returns during many individual months and even several calendar years were negative. Most years yielded returns that [deviated significantly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhYHrHiOS_E&ab_channel=BenFelixBenFelixVerified) from the average: seemingly extreme returns, like +20% or -8%, should be part of expectations. We can’t be sure if future returns will be as high as those in the past — don't count on 11%. But the historical record illustrates that diversified index funds carry risk of loss only in the short term; in the long term, they will grow as long as society continues to function normally.

The question which follows for most people is what portion of their wealth is safe to invest in stocks and other assets, given that they may need to draw on investments due to emergencies, insufficient income for normal expenses, or large purchases such as a car or house. The great fear is that, when in need of money, they will turn to the investments meant to expand their wealth and find that instead they have lost value, perhaps drastically. Some forms of this fear are valid and the risks of any investment should be researched before action is taken. If you will _need_ the money you’re considering investing a year from now, and you will need _all_ of it, then stock funds are unsuitable, and any securities with higher risk (such as individual stocks) are unsuitable.

&nbsp;

## Bonds and the spectrum of risk

How can you invest money that can’t be exposed to the volatility of the stock market? A primary way of doing this is through [bonds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bond.asp). Banks make money by providing people with loans in exchange for interest payments and the eventual repayment of the principal. Like banks, you can invest in debt through bonds, also known as fixed income. Bonds have less risk and less long-term return than stocks, partly because bondholders have higher priority than common stockholders if a company declares bankruptcy. Bonds with longer maturity — those with timelines up to 30 years until the debt is fully paid — have higher risk and return than those with shorter maturity. Bonds which are [less likely](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditquality.asp) to be paid back in full command higher returns to accompany their risk. Without needing to deeply understand how individual bonds are priced and sold, anyone can easily invest in government and corporate bonds through an ETF or mutual fund.

We can think about the role of bonds by walking through layers of risk and return. First is your checking account, which holds money you anticipate using in the immediate future. A checking account has zero risk and zero return. What could you do to generate modest returns for the money you don’t need at your fingertips, without exposing it to substantial risk? The most straightforward candidate is a fund with high-quality, short-term bonds. This is a place for slow, safe growth. It can hold money you anticipate needing in the next one to two years. Close to rock bottom for the slowest, safest growth is a short-term US treasury bond fund ([VGSH](https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/VGSH) / [SHY](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239452/ishares-13-year-treasury-bond-etf) / [SPTS](https://www.ssga.com/us/en/individual/etfs/funds/spdr-portfolio-short-term-treasury-etf-spts) / [SCHO](https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/products/scho)). If you are willing to accept minor, occasional declines in value, you will find greater overall appreciation in a short-term bond fund ([BSV](https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/overview/BSV) / [SWSBX](https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/products/swsbx)) or a short-term corporate bond fund ([VCSH](https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/VCSH) / [IGSB](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239451/ishares-13-year-credit-bond-etf) / [SPSB](https://www.ssga.com/us/en/individual/etfs/funds/spdr-portfolio-short-term-corporate-bond-etf-spsb) / [SCHJ](https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/products/schj)). A broader bond fund like BSV contains both government and corporate bonds, so funds like VCSH that hold purely corporate bonds generate greater long-term growth and harbor more potential for small declines in value. Returns from short-term bond funds may seem trivial, but they become impressive in the long run and are far better than returns from a savings account, certificate of deposit, or [money market fund](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/money-marketfund.asp).<sup id="fn1">[1](#f1)</sup> Any portion can be promptly withdrawn when you need it.

Behind your short-term bonds should be intermediate- and long-term bonds. Here you could hold part of the money reserved for periods beyond the nearest future but in the upcoming five years. Long-term bonds are riskier than short-term bonds but far safer than stocks. Their average growth is much stronger than that of short-term bond funds. You could use a long-term bond fund ([BLV](https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/BLV) / [ILTB](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239424/ishares-core-longterm-us-bond-etf)) or a long-term corporate bond fund ([VCLT](https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/VCLT) / [IGLB](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239423/ishares-10-year-credit-bond-etf) / [SPLB](https://www.ssga.com/us/en/individual/etfs/funds/spdr-portfolio-long-term-corporate-bond-etf-splb)). As before, the corporate bond funds entail somewhat more return as well as higher risk of moderate dips in value. If you decide there is a role in your portfolio for the temperate qualities of intermediate-term bonds, there are several offerings for corporate bond funds ([VCIT](https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/overview/VCIT) / [IGIB](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239463/ishares-intermediate-credit-bond-etf) / [SPIB](https://www.ssga.com/us/en/individual/etfs/funds/spdr-portfolio-intermediate-term-corporate-bond-etf-spib) / [SCHI](https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/products/schi)) and broader funds which hold both government and corporate bonds ([BIV](https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/overview/BIV) / [IMTB](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/285539/ishares-core-5-10-year-usd-bond-etf)).

In contrast to the minor volatility of short-term bond funds, there are some years in which long-term bond funds undergo significant dips in total return (i.e., a single-digit percentage). They are more vulnerable to the [risk of interest rates rising](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestraterisk.asp) as well as the risk that a change in economic circumstances will increase [defaults on corporate debt](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/defaultrisk.asp). Rising interest rates cause existing bonds to fall in value because terms of payment for the bondholders become less attractive than those of new bonds with higher interest payments. A decline in interest rates would be a boon to long-term bonds, but interest rates are already at historically low levels. Although not a strict prerequisite for investing in bonds, understanding the concept of bond [duration](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/duration.asp) will improve your appreciation for how interest rates affect bond valuation.

If you’d prefer only one bond fund, you could buy shares of a total US bond fund ([BND](https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/BND) / [AGG](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239458/ishares-core-total-us-bond-market-etf) / [SPAB](https://www.ssga.com/us/en/individual/etfs/funds/spdr-portfolio-aggregate-bond-etf-spab) / [SCHZ](https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/products/schz)), a total US corporate bond fund ([VTC](https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/overview/VTC) / [LQD](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239566/ishares-iboxx-investment-grade-corporate-bond-etf) / [SPBO](https://www.ssga.com/us/en/individual/etfs/funds/spdr-portfolio-corporate-bond-etf-spbo)), or a total global bond fund ([BNDW](https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/overview/BNDW)). But your allocation of different bond maturities, and the overall risk-return profile, may not be ideal. The interest rate risk levels of these aggregate funds are about the same or somewhat higher than those of intermediate-term funds. Regardless of your selections, ensure that each fund’s expense ratio is very low. The comparatively low returns of bonds make this especially important. See the [fund proposal section](https://github.com/investindex/Funds#summary) for a summary table of all the bond funds.

Bond funds typically pay monthly dividends. The best default for most people is to automatically reinvest these dividends in more shares of the fund. When you need to withdraw money from the fund, you can either turn off automatic reinvestment and wait for the next dividend payment, or you can simply sell shares of the fund. See the [section on taxes](https://github.com/investindex/Taxes) for the different tax implications these actions carry.

Finally, behind your long-term bond funds should be the stock index funds introduced at the beginning. They will generate the bulk of your investment returns. The various funds that could form your stock portfolio will be discussed in later sections. First, we should address how to think through allocation of your reserves to stocks and long-term bonds.

&nbsp;

## Allocation and overall risk

One way of assessing how you should distribute your risk is considering what your worst-case scenario would be given a possible distribution. First consider what could go wrong in your life anytime: a totaled car, a health crisis, an unexpected home repair, loss of your income or the income of anyone who might depend on you. Then consider that something like this might happen around the same time that your investments drop significantly in value. This would be unlucky, but your financial planning should account for it.

Another risk to consider is the possibility of not meeting your basic needs and personal goals in the long run. You could keep everything in short-term bonds for decades and never suffer a major loss, but the missed opportunities would be vast. Your approach should not be so conservative that it fails to provide you with enough money throughout your working life or during retirement.

Note the tension between these considerations. Envisioning your long-term goals will push you toward more risk and return, whereas recalling the possibility of loss in the short term will remind you to approach risk carefully.

### Preparing for loss

How risky are stocks and bonds? The risk presented by individual stocks and by a diversified stock portfolio are fundamentally different. A single stock can lose nearly all of its value and never recover. A diversified index fund or group of funds tracking the US or global stock market will eventually rebound from downturns. The crucial difference is that a diversified investor need not worry about unrecoverable losses if they have the financial and psychological means to simply wait. So the primary concern is better thought of as volatility rather than loss, because however terrifying it may be, unrealized loss is temporary for a diversified stockholder.

Periods of major unrealized loss are sometimes brief. After the market crashed in February and March 2020, it took only six months from the beginning of the [drawdown](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/drawdown.asp) for the S&P 500 to exceed its previous peak. Less commonly, this process can also take several years. The decline beginning in October 2007 lasted until March 2009, and recovery did not occur until March 2013, nearly five and a half years after the drawdown began. The Great Recession was not even the longest in modern history: a [bear market](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bearmarket.asp) starting in January 1973 did not see its bottom until October 1974 or a recovery until July 1980, for a total of seven and a half years.<sup id="fn2">[2](#f2)</sup> Keep in mind that the drawdowns beginning in 1973 and 2007 were unusually severe; only the Great Depression was deeper and longer. The take-home message is that periods of major unrealized loss vary greatly, and this uncertainty is part of the psychological struggle. Participation in the stock market means being prepared for a multiyear period in which returns are zero.

There are two positive notes to counterbalance this bleak reminder. First, as disastrous as these bear markets might seem in the midst of them, the period we reviewed from 1980 to 2020 included numerous bear markets and still emerged with fantastic overall returns. Second, [risk factor diversification](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKWbW7Wgm0w&ab_channel=BenFelix) can significantly reduce the duration of these drawdowns, compared to a portfolio of only the S&P 500 or only the total market. Small cap value stocks recovered from the 1970s bear market several years earlier than the S&P 500, and their overall performance for the decade [crushed](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-asset-class-allocation) the performance of large cap stocks (like the S&P 500). The 1970s would have been a decade of strong growth for someone who highly overweighted small cap value stocks. We will expand on risk factor diversification in the [section on stock portfolios](https://github.com/investindex/Portfolio).

Disasters for long-term bonds are comparatively mild. The worst three-year period in modern US history for long-term government bonds was [the period ending](https://www.thebalance.com/rolling-index-returns-4061795) in September 1981. Annual returns were about -6% on average for three consecutive years. Based on the historical data, I will suggest the following disaster scenarios for financial planning: a 20% [drawdown](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/drawdown.asp) of long-term bonds or an 80% drawdown of the stock market.

Such events are expected to be extremely rare, and they are not characteristic of an overwhelming majority of declines in value for stock or long-term bond indices. In particular, many people argue that the US stock market is far more transparent and better-regulated than during the Great Depression era, and that an enduring collapse like that one is inconceivable now.<sup id="fn3">[3](#f3)</sup> I am tempted to agree, but it is hard to agree so completely that I would stake my financial solvency on it.

Could both of these drawdowns happen at the same time? Large declines in the value of stock funds and long-term bond funds are unlikely to co-occur for very long. In the event of a bear market, the Federal Reserve lowers interest rates to encourage borrowing and spending, which boosts long-term bonds. Of course, corporate bonds with high default risk are in particular jeopardy when the stock market plummets, which is why I recommend government and investment-grade corporate bonds, not [high-yield bonds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/high_yield_bond.asp).

So it may be most realistic to work out your financial situation if you needed to draw on your investments at the bottom of an 80% decline in stocks _or_ a 20% decline in long-term bonds. Keep in mind that this is a rule of thumb optimizing for simplicity, and other reasonable rules exist. The guideline is deliberately conservative, so a vast majority of future drawdowns will not approach these extremes.

### Preparing for the long run

We also need to consider how investments will reward us throughout our life, and especially during retirement. 

Factors over which you exercise some control include:  
-Income during your working years and changes in income over time;  
-Allocation and timing of investments;  
-Use of [tax-advantaged accounts](https://github.com/investindex/Guidelines#tax-advantaged-accounts);  
-At what age you may merge finances with a long-term partner;  
-At what age you may have children;  
-Support you expect to provide to and receive from your family;  
-How much you will spend, save, and invest during working years;  
-How much you will change your spending after retirement;  
-How you will change your investment approach after retirement;  
-Age of retirement;  
-Whether you retire suddenly or continue earning a smaller income for some time;  
-Personal goals such as charitable donations or leaving money for your children.

Factors over which you exercise little or no control include:  
-[Asset class](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/assetclasses.asp) returns for stocks and bonds;  
-Inflation rates;  
-Interest rates;  
-Tax rates;  
-Government benefits like Social Security, which may change by the time you retire.  

Many of these variables can be entered into an online retirement calculator like [this one](https://www.bankrate.com/retirement/calculators/retirement-plan-calculator/). Basic calculators give you an idea of how your saving and investing will add up in the long run, and whether they can sustain you during retirement. But make sure to consider the factors not explicitly included in these calculators, like unexpected support you may need to provide to children or aging parents in middle age, and potentially very high medical costs in old age. These calculations will be rough. The future is uncertain and it’s not possible to include everything that could influence your wealth. But working out imprecise numbers is far better than the vague assumptions that would take their place. Planning your future will also demonstrate how useful it is to keep track of your spending. Exactly how much do you spend on food? How much does car maintenance cost? You will be able to project future spending far more accurately if you record and categorize your current spending. You may also be able to target areas in which you’re spending more than you thought.

Although there are variables you cannot control, like federal tax rates, you can adjust variables which are under your control, like savings rates, to make it more likely that you’ll be prepared for an uncertain future. There are also factors which are under your control to a great degree, except in rare situations. Health is a perfect example: most people have the opportunity to reduce expected health care costs by keeping themselves healthy, but it is always possible to be dealt an unavoidable illness or injury. Risks like these are covered in the [next section's guidelines](https://github.com/investindex/Guidelines#minimize-risk-of-catastrophic-loss).

&nbsp;

## Retirement math

A few methods of retirement calculation are worth reviewing here. First, a simple matter of computing average return. If over three years our investments provide annual returns of 7%, 15.5%, and -2%, what is the average annual return? We must convert these percentage changes to multipliers: 1.07, 1.155, and .98. The geometric mean is calculated as (1.07×1.155×.98)^(1/3) = 1.0659, a 6.59% average annual return. See this footnote for why it must be calculated that way.<sup id="fn4">[4](#f4)</sup>

Second, how does inflation work when calculating returns? We can calculate growth over time based on an anticipated average rate of return. If we assume a 9% average annual return over 40 years, the asset will be multiplied by 1.09^40 = 31.4. This is our nominal return. The real return — that which remains after accounting for inflation — is smaller. This is often done casually by subtracting percentages: assuming 9% average nominal growth and 2.5% average inflation, real returns are 6.5%. It's a rough approximation. It should be calculated as 1.09/1.025 = 1.0634, or a 6.34% real average return. This gives us a real multiplier of (1.09/1.025)^40 = 11.7. So instead of imagining that your money will multiply by 31.4, remember that your dollars will be worth less in 40 years, and the multiplier will feel much more like 11.7. If this shrinking multiplier is discouraging, imagine how your assets would decay if you didn't invest at all: (1/1.025)^40 = .372. They would lose 63% of their value over 40 years! A 9% nominal return converts that multiplier of .37 to 11.7.

Finally, how can we find the savings needed to spend a given amount during retirement, while accounting for inflation and investment earnings? Let's imagine that we want an annual "income" of $60,000 in today's dollars by drawing from our investments and receiving Social Security payments. Keep in mind that this is for an individual — a married couple would need to spend more, but probably not twice as much. We've used the government's calculator and estimated that our middle-class income will entitle us to about $15K per year from Social Security. We'll rely on on our investments for the remaining $45K. These amounts are expressed in today's dollars, because that's what we can relate to ($161K of inflated dollars 40 years in the future is not intuitive). We decide that we'll commit to withdrawing an average of 3% of the nest egg per year, reducing it slightly when our investments drop in value and potentially increasing it when our investments perform very well. An average 3% withdrawal of $45K translates to a nest egg of 45,000×(100/3) = 1,500,000. Assuming 2.5% average inflation for 40 years, $1.5M in today's dollars would be multiplied by 1.025^40 to give $4.03M. That's the actual dollar amount we're aiming for to provide a standard of living equivalent to $60K/year today. How can we reach it?

There are many ways of doing so. One method is simple and allows us to know in advance how much we'll need to save every year for the next 40 years. We save and invest $8,361 the first year, and every year we increase that amount by our anticipated average inflation rate, 2.5%. So in the second year we save $8,571, and so on until we save $21,902 in the 40th year. If our nominal returns are as expected, around 9%, then we'll have saved $563,584 and built a nest egg of $4.03M by the end of the 40th year. This method also illustrates how important it is to start early. Our initial dollar amount is $8,361 if we have a 40-year horizon, but with 30 years the number is $16,797; with 20 years it is $36,959; and with 10 years it is $105,312. When you start late, you give your capital less time to appreciate. See this footnote for how to calculate that initial amount.<sup id="fn5">[5](#f5)</sup>

The underlying assumptions are open to question: someone might object that a 3% average withdrawal rate is overly conservative, or that 2.5% anticipated inflation is not conservative enough. Indeed, you should calculate what your retirement plan looks like in a future with poor performance: 7% nominal stock market returns and 3.5% inflation, yielding a real annual return of 3.38% (1.07/1.035 = 1.0338). The 40-year real multiplier drops from 11.7 in our example above to only 3.8. This is a very pessimistic projection, but if your retirement plan is not robust enough to survive this scenario, you're not fully prepared for an uncertain future.

It spent significant periods with a drawdown in excess of 80%: all days but one between Apr 8 and Aug 2 1932, and again most days between Feb 14 and Apr 7 1933.

<sup id="f4"> 4 </sup> For some people it may not be obvious why the more common arithmetic mean is unsuitable. Perhaps we could have found the average return like this: (7+15.5-2)/3 = 6.83 or (1.07+1.155+.98)/3 = 1.0683. To consider this, we can imagine an unlikely sequence of returns, in which we double our money the first year and halve it the following year. Multiplying an asset by 2 and then .5 returns it to its original value. We can calculate the geometric mean of these multipliers, which we know intuitively should be 1: (2×.5)^(1/2) = 1. That's right, but the arithmetic mean gives us an incorrect answer, (2+.5)/2 = 1.25. Another way of checking this is finding that the average return matches the actual return. 1.07×1.155×.98 = 1.21, which equals 1.0659^3. The arithmetic mean of 1.0683 does not satisfy this test. Because we are averaging multiplicative factors, the geometric mean must be applied. [↩](#fn3)
