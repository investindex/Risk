# Thinking about risk

“How should I invest my money?” is a question that cannot be avoided — to invest none of it is a tacit decision. Any good answer would be highly personalized, but the right information about risk can help anyone think about this question.

In the context of investment, one can consider risk of loss on a spectrum: some securities can safely be considered to carry no risk, like [certificates of deposit](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/certificateofdeposit.asp); some have moderate risk, such as diversified stock funds; and others carry high risk, such as [hedge fund purchases of distressed debt](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/bonds/08/distressed-debt-hedge-fund.asp). The lowest-risk options generate small returns and, in the current low-interest environment, will not even keep pace with inflation. Stock market index funds require the investor to accept meaningful risk, with the potential for much greater reward.

What do lifetime returns from index funds look like? According to [this article](https://web.archive.org/web/20210103035544/https://www.wsj.com/articles/lessons-from-a-crazy-year-in-financial-markets-11609410602), placing $10,000 in an S&P 500 index fund in Jan 1980 with dividend reinvestments would have yielded nearly $700,000 of growth by August 2020. This is an impressive reward for leaving money alone, especially in contrast to any low-risk alternative. The average annual return was [just over 11%](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%28707421%2F10000%29%5E%281%2F%2840%2B2%2F3%29%29). Now imagine a different scenario, in which you added savings to a [tax-advantaged retirement account](https://github.com/investindex/Guidelines#tax-advantaged-accounts) at the beginning of every year. You started with $1,000 in 1980 and increased by $100 each year through 2020. For simplicity, imagine that your investment grew at the average rate the whole time. By the end of August 2020 you contributed [$123,000](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=Sum%5B1000%2B100n%2C+%7Bn%2C+0%2C+40%7D%5D) but your account reached a value of about [$1.3 million](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=Sum%5B%281000%2B100n%29*1.1104113%5E%282%2F3%2B40-n%29%2C+%7Bn%2C+0%2C+40%7D%5D). These examples are simplistic but exhibit the power of compounding growth.

We can’t be sure what future returns will be — don't count on 11%, which is much higher than the global average of about 8%.<sup id="fn1">[[1]](#f1)</sup> Between 1980 and 2020, the returns during many individual months and even several calendar years were negative. Most years yielded returns that deviated significantly from the average: returns such as +20% or -10% should be part of expectations. See the plot below, which displays calendar year returns in the US [stock](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-asset-class-allocation?s=y&mode=1&timePeriod=4&startYear=2000&firstMonth=1&endYear=2021&lastMonth=12&calendarAligned=true&includeYTD=false&initialAmount=10000&annualOperation=0&annualAdjustment=0&inflationAdjusted=true&annualPercentage=0.0&frequency=4&rebalanceType=1&absoluteDeviation=5.0&relativeDeviation=25.0&leverageType=0&leverageRatio=0.0&debtAmount=0&debtInterest=0.0&maintenanceMargin=25.0&leveragedBenchmark=false&portfolioNames=false&portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&asset1=TotalStockMarket&allocation1_1=100) and [bond](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-asset-class-allocation?s=y&mode=1&timePeriod=4&startYear=2000&firstMonth=1&endYear=2021&lastMonth=12&calendarAligned=true&includeYTD=false&initialAmount=10000&annualOperation=0&annualAdjustment=0&inflationAdjusted=true&annualPercentage=0.0&frequency=4&rebalanceType=1&absoluteDeviation=5.0&relativeDeviation=25.0&leverageType=0&leverageRatio=0.0&debtAmount=0&debtInterest=0.0&maintenanceMargin=25.0&leveragedBenchmark=false&portfolioNames=false&portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&asset1=TotalBond&allocation1_1=100) markets since 2000. Note how most of the annual stock returns fall far from the average (the purple diamond). The returns for US aggregate bonds cluster more closely around the average, but in exchange for the benefit of reduced volatility, the average return is lower.

In this period of 22 calendar years, a negative bond return occured in 14% of years, and a negative stock return in 23% of years. Viewing only annual returns obscures a lot of volatility — we can zoom in on monthly returns. About 33% of months for bonds and 35% of months for stocks were negative. We can even [estimate](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5ESP500TR) what portion of days were negative in the US stock market: about 46%. This illustrates one of the essential lessons of investing in volatile assets: returns in the short term have a considerable probability of being negative — a single day is nearly a coin flip. But diversified investors can be assured that as they invest over long periods, their probability of reaping a positive return creeps up toward 100%. See [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhYHrHiOS_E) for a great explanation of this.

## Understanding bonds and their risks

How can you invest money that can’t be exposed to the volatility of the stock market? The most common way of doing this is through [bonds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bond.asp). Most people know that banks make money by providing people with loans in exchange for repayment with interest. Like banks, you can invest in debt through bonds, also known as fixed income. Bonds are liquid assets and can be traded, although not as easily as stocks. Anyone can invest in government and corporate bonds through an ETF or mutual fund. Some examples of large bond issuers include the federal US government, Microsoft, Bank of America, and Boeing. A bond fund purchases many bonds representing debt on the part of each bond issuer, and the bond issuers pay the fund. Payments from the bond issuer to the bondholder are called [coupon payments](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/coupon.asp), and they usually occur semi-annually. The payments are complete for a particular bond when it reaches maturity. Upon maturity, the issuer pays back the amount they originally borrowed, an amount which is called the face value of the bond. Funds pass on these payments to shareholders in the form of cash dividends. The fund's share price corresponds to the market value of the bonds.

Bonds have less risk and less long-term return than stocks. This is partly because, if a company declares bankruptcy, the bondholders' claim to company assets takes priority over that of common stockholders. If a bond issuer is unable to pay their debt, this is referred to as [default](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/defaultrisk.asp). Bonds which are less likely to be paid back in full command higher returns to accompany their risk. US Treasury bonds are less risky than corporate bonds, and corporate bonds are divided into two broad categories based on [credit quality](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditquality.asp): investment-grade bonds (with comparatively low risk) and [high-yield bonds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/high_yield_bond.asp) (also known as junk bonds).

Bonds present two broad dimensions of risk.

Longer-term bonds are riskier than shorter-term bonds. A primary driver of term risk is the more specific [interest rate risk](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestraterisk.asp), because longer-term bonds are more sensitive to the risk of interest rates rising. Why is that a risk? Rising interest rates cause existing bonds to fall in value because terms of payment for the bondholders become less attractive than those of new bonds with higher interest payments. A decline in interest rates would be a boon to the market value of bonds, especially long-term bonds, although interest rates are currently at historically low levels. It's important to stress that changes in interest rates do not affect the income from existing bonds. They affect the market value of existing bonds, which corresponds to a fund's share price. Although not a strict prerequisite for investing in bonds, understanding the concept of bond [duration](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/duration.asp) will improve your appreciation for how interest rates affect bond valuation.<sup id="fn3">[[3]](#f3)</sup>

The second type of risk is credit risk, which encompasses (a) the risk that [defaults](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/defaultrisk.asp) on debt will increase unexpectedly as well as (b) the risk that credit ratings of the bond issuers will be [downgraded](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/022615/what-types-financial-situations-would-credit-spread-risk-be-applied-instead-default-risk.asp). These are usually referred to as "default risk" and "credit migration risk", respectively. Upgrading or downgrading of a bond issuer's credit rating changes the market value of the bond but not the income. Default means a bond issuer has missed payments, which has obvious negative effects on both income from the bond as well as its market value. High-yield bonds provide higher long-term return because the issuers have poor credit quality, and they must compensate investors for accepting a greater risk of default (relative to investment-grade corporate bond issuers). US Treasury bonds are among the safest in the world, so their risk and return are comparatively low.

Long-term bonds are typically defined as those with 10-30 years until maturity. Intermediate-term may be defined as 3-10 or 5-10 years, and short-term may be defined as 1-3 or 1-5 years. Bonds called ultrashort-term usually have about 1 year or less until maturity.

We discussed the term "high-yield bond" above. What exactly is [yield](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bond-yield.asp)? The most important variation is current yield: the sum of a bond's annual coupon payments divided by its current market price. If interest rates rise, causing bond prices to fall, then the current yield has increased. When you read in _The Wall Street Journal_ that bond yields fell today, they're referring to current yield. And because current yield has an inverse relationship with bond prices, you can infer that prices increased. Bond funds can differ greatly in their yield. As of this writing, the ultrashort-term bond fund [VUSB](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/vusb) has a yield of 1.92%, whereas the high-yield bond fund [USHY](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/291299/) has a yield of 6.41% (see the SEC yield on each webpage).

Bond funds typically pay monthly dividends. The best default for most people is to automatically reinvest these dividends in more shares of the fund. When you need to withdraw money from the fund, you could turn off automatic reinvestment and wait for the next dividend payment. However, selling shares of the fund is more likely to be suitable both in terms of timing and the dollar amount you need. See the [section on taxes](https://github.com/investindex/Taxes) for the different tax implications these actions carry. I mentioned previously that stock ETFs are more tax-efficient than stock mutual funds, but the distinction does not apply as strongly to bond funds. This is because unlike stock ETFs, bond ETFs sometimes need to [distribute capital gains](https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/investment-products/etf/etfs-tax-efficiency). So for instance, someone investing in bonds in a taxable Schwab brokerage account has little tax-related incentive to prefer the ETF [SCHZ](https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/products/schz) to the mutual fund [SWAGX](https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/products/swagx). As long as buying shares of SWAGX does not entail a fee — which it does not because this person is using a Schwab account — they may prefer SWAGX because it allows them to invest a precise dollar amount.

How do bond funds fit into your portfolio?

&nbsp;

## Investing in bonds and navigating the spectrum of risk

I will provide at least one example of each type of bond fund as I review them. The default will be a fund from BlackRock, simply because they have a great display in which you can easily view the total return starting and ending at any date (for example, see [AGG](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239458/ishares-core-total-us-bond-market-etf)). It shows how an initial investment of $10,000 would have changed in value over time, and I encourage you to click on a fund from each paragraph to see its total return over the history of the fund. This will give you an idea of the fund's possible future behavior, although keep in mind that no fund currently in operation has a history long enough to show the full range of possibilities. Later in this section, we'll discuss historical examples of extreme scenarios.

We can think about the role of bonds by walking through layers of risk and return. First is your checking account, which holds money you anticipate using in the immediate future. A checking account has zero risk and zero return. What could you do to generate modest returns for the money you don’t need at your fingertips, without exposing it to substantial risk? We should seek a fund with low credit risk _and_ low interest rate risk, which means it would hold high-quality, short-term bonds. This is suitable for money you anticipate needing in the next one to two years. Close to rock bottom for the slowest, safest growth is a short-term US treasury bond fund (e.g., [SHY](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239452/ishares-13-year-treasury-bond-etf)). There are also broader short-term funds with both government and corporate bonds, like [BSV](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/bsv) and [AVSF](https://www.avantisinvestors.com/content/avantis/en/investments/avantis-short-term-fixed-income-etf.html). Returns from short-term bond funds may seem trivial, but they become impressive in the long run and are generally better than returns from a savings account, [money market fund](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/money-marketfund.asp), or certificate of deposit.<sup id="fn2">[[2]](#f2)</sup> Any portion can be promptly withdrawn when you need it.

Behind your short-term bonds should be intermediate- and long-term bonds. Here you could hold part of the money reserved for periods beyond the nearest future but in the next two to eight years. Intermediate-term funds include [IMTB](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/285539/ishares-core-5-10-year-usd-bond-etf) and long-term funds include [ILTB](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239424/ishares-core-longterm-us-bond-etf). Due to their high risk, long-term bonds have high expected return and can even beat stocks over extended periods. Intermediate- and long-term treasury bonds (e.g., [IEF](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239456/ishares-710-year-treasury-bond-etf)) in particular have [low correlation to stocks](https://github.com/investindex/Risk/blob/main/LongTermTreasury.pdf), providing a [diversification](https://github.com/investindex/Portfolio#clarifying-diversification) benefit. However, due to low interest rates, the near-term outlook for bonds is not as bright as it was in the past, so we can't expect a repeat of the [performance](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-asset-class-allocation?s=y&mode=1&timePeriod=4&startYear=1978&firstMonth=1&endYear=2008&lastMonth=12&calendarAligned=true&includeYTD=false&initialAmount=10000&annualOperation=0&annualAdjustment=0&inflationAdjusted=true&annualPercentage=0.0&frequency=4&rebalanceType=1&absoluteDeviation=5.0&relativeDeviation=25.0&leverageType=0&leverageRatio=0.0&debtAmount=0&debtInterest=0.0&maintenanceMargin=25.0&leveragedBenchmark=false&portfolioNames=false&portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&asset1=TreasuryNotes&allocation1_1=100&asset2=LongTreasury&allocation2_2=100&asset3=LongCorpBond&allocation3_3=100) from the last several decades. This kind of forecast is not possible to make where stocks are concerned — at least not with any confidence — but the future returns of bonds are more predictable. [In](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/TB3MS) [the](https://www.macrotrends.net/2015/fed-funds-rate-historical-chart) [1980s](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-asset-class-allocation?s=y&mode=1&timePeriod=4&startYear=1978&firstMonth=1&endYear=1995&lastMonth=12&calendarAligned=true&includeYTD=false&initialAmount=10000&annualOperation=0&annualAdjustment=0&inflationAdjusted=true&annualPercentage=0.0&frequency=4&rebalanceType=1&absoluteDeviation=5.0&relativeDeviation=25.0&leverageType=0&leverageRatio=0.0&debtAmount=0&debtInterest=0.0&maintenanceMargin=25.0&leveragedBenchmark=false&portfolioNames=false&portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&asset1=TreasuryBills&allocation1_1=100&asset2=ShortTreasury&allocation2_2=100&asset3=LongTreasury&allocation3_3=100), you could hold even short-term treasury bonds and collect a good return with low risk. However, you would pay [very high](https://www.macrotrends.net/2604/30-year-fixed-mortgage-rate-chart) interest rates as a borrower — perhaps 13% on your home mortgage — and inflation was high. Bonds still function as risk control, of course, but can't contribute to returns in the same way.

If you’d prefer only one bond fund, you could buy shares of a fund with bonds of maturities balanced between short, intermediate, and long. If someone says they are invested in "bonds" rather vaguely, they're probably invested in a fund like this. These aggregate bond market funds are usually a US bond fund (e.g., [AGG](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239458/ishares-core-total-us-bond-market-etf)) or a combination of US and international funds ([BNDW](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/bndw)). They can also be a US treasury bond fund (e.g., [GOVT](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239468/ishares-us-treasury-bond-etf)) or a US corporate bond fund (e.g., [LQD](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239566/ishares-iboxx-investment-grade-corporate-bond-etf)). Your distribution of bond maturities, and the overall risk-return profile, may not be ideal, but for many people aggregate funds strike a good balance. The interest rate risk levels of these funds are about the same or somewhat higher than those of intermediate-term funds. In addition to government and corporate bonds, aggregate funds contain [mortgage-backed securities](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mbs.asp). These are bonds created by pooling mortgage debt from many people. You don't necessarily need to buy shares in a mortgage-backed securities fund (e.g., [MBB](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239465/ishares-mbs-etf)), but it's useful to understand the different types of debt held in aggregate funds.

Behind your high-quality bonds of various maturities might be high-yield bonds (e.g., [USHY](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/291299/ishares-broad-usd-high-yield-corporate-bond-etf)), issued by companies with low credit ratings. With inception in 1978, [VWEHX](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/mutual-funds/profile/vwehx) has the [longest history](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-asset-class-allocation?s=y&mode=1&timePeriod=4&startYear=1972&firstMonth=1&endYear=2022&lastMonth=12&calendarAligned=true&includeYTD=false&initialAmount=10000&annualOperation=0&annualAdjustment=0&inflationAdjusted=true&annualPercentage=0.0&frequency=4&rebalanceType=1&absoluteDeviation=5.0&relativeDeviation=25.0&leverageType=0&leverageRatio=0.0&debtAmount=0&debtInterest=0.0&maintenanceMargin=25.0&leveragedBenchmark=false&portfolioNames=false&portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&asset1=HighYield&allocation1_1=100) you can observe, which includes the 2008 financial crisis. Another fund from BlackRock is [SHYG](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/258100/ishares-05-year-high-yield-corporate-bond-etf), which combines low interest rate risk with high credit risk. Be aware that while bonds with high credit quality can act as a countervailing force when stocks crash, high-yield bonds tend to fall along with stocks (by much less). This is because they are issued by companies which are more vulnerable to economic downturns. So they do not occupy the same role as a potential hedge in your portfolio.

### Bond-like bond funds

Bond funds have multiple advantages over individual bonds: you own a diversified portfolio in a single security; transaction costs are lower because large asset managers trade in bulk; international bond funds eliminate currency risk through [currency hedging](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/070815/how-currencyhedged-etfs-work.asp); and you can reinvest any amount back into the fund, rather than needing enough to buy more bonds. Finally, bond funds do the work of maintaining the same characteristics over time. If you built your own bond portfolio with an average maturity of six years, a year later the average maturity would be five years, and the risk-return profile would have changed. But as you get older, a bond _fund_ stays the same age.

However, what if you don't want the bond fund to stay the same? Let's say you're saving for a specific goal at the beginning of 2029, and you want the bonds in your portfolio to approach maturity at the end of 2028, becoming gradually less risky as time passes. For those who want this, there are bond funds that terminate on a specific date like an individual bond. You could invest in [IBTI](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/312463/ishares-ibonds-dec-2028-term-treasury-etf-fund) and [BSCS](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?productId=ETF-BSCS), which currently hold intermediate-term bonds, but will hold very short-term bonds in six years. The bonds will mature throughout 2028 and they will distribute the cash to shareholders in December 2028. They're called term-maturity bond funds or target maturity bond funds, and you can choose from BlackRock's [iBonds ETFs](https://www.ishares.com/us/strategies/bond-etfs/build-better-bond-ladders) and Invesco's [Bulletshares ETFs](https://www.invesco.com/us/en/solutions/invesco-etfs/bulletshares-fixed-income-etfs.html).

### US Treasury Savings Bonds

US Treasury savings bonds are as close to risk-free as any investment can be. They are not tradable on the secondary market: you purchase and redeem them directly from the US Treasury. Unlike marketable bonds, there is a one-year lock-up period during which you cannot redeem the bonds, so you must be certain you won't need the money for a year. They must be purchased at [treasurydirect.gov](https://www.treasurydirect.gov), not through a brokerage account.

There are two types, called Series I and Series EE. Series I savings bonds, often just called I-bonds, are linked to inflation. A new annualized interest rate is set every six months in November and May based on recent changes in the urban consumer price index (CPI-U). Because inflation is currently high, the annualized rate determined by inflation is high. The rate jumped to 7.12% in November 2021 and 9.62% in May 2022. This interest rate is called the "variable rate". When you buy I-bonds, the variable rate persists for six months, then switches to the new variable rate every six months. So if you bought I-bonds in January 2022, the variable rate would be 7.12% and [would not change](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/research/indepth/ibonds/res_ibonds_iratesandterms.htm#change) to the new rate of 9.62% until July (even though the new rate is set in May). In addition to the variable rate of an I-bond, there is a [fixed rate](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/research/indepth/ibonds/res_ibonds_iratesandterms.htm) that is constant for as long as you hold the bond. It is added to the variable rate to produce a combined rate, but the fixed rate is currently zero, so the combined rate is 7.12%. Because the variable rate is equal to the CPI-U, it is possible for deflation to cause a negative variable rate. If the fixed rate were positive and the variable rate were negative, the combined rate could be less than the fixed rate. But the combined rate cannot fall below zero. These bonds never lose value.

Series EE bonds are simpler: they have a fixed rate which is currently a pitiful 0.1%. However, their special feature is that they double in value if held for 20 years, through a one-time adjustment. 2^(1/20) = 1.0353, so the interest rate if left for 20 years is a guaranteed 3.53%. There have been [periods](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/research/indepth/ebonds/res_e_bonds_eeratesandterms.htm) in which the fixed rate exceeded 3.53%, making the 20-year adjustment unnecessary. It would make sense to prefer Series EE bonds if (a) you will certainly stay invested for at least 20 years, and (b) you believe that average inflation is likely to be less than 3.53% during the subsequent 20 years. Most people should not choose the Series EE bonds.

The maximum purchase per calendar year is $10,000 of each type of savings bond per person. However, you can add an additional $5,000 of I-bonds per year by overpaying your taxes and [directing the IRS](https://www.irs.gov/refunds/using-your-income-tax-refund-to-save-by-buying-us-savings-bonds) to use your refund to buy these bonds. Your spouse and your children have their own $10,000 limits, so you could buy one in your child's name (or the names of other trusted relatives). You can purchase another $10,000 if you have a corporation, using its employer identification number (EIN) instead of your Social Security number. It's not hard to register a corporation if you really wanted to use it for this. You can also buy more with a [trust](https://thefinancebuff.com/buy-more-i-bonds-treasury-direct-trust.html). If you think the interest rates are going to be lower in the near future and want to load up while they're high, you and a trusted person can buy them for each other in the [gift box](https://thefinancebuff.com/buy-i-bonds-as-gift.html) and deliver them in a later year.

If you buy I-bonds every year, you'll eventually build up an asset with no downside risk that thrives when inflation is high and can be cashed out at any time (except the most recent year's purchase). This is important, because there are no reliably good investments in high-inflation environments ([gold is not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0dns9fHFs&t=2766s), although some people think it is). The government created I-bonds because inflation — in particular, unexpectedly high inflation — is so harmful to investments as well as cash savings.<sup id="fn4">[[4]](#f4)</sup> You can even designate your I-bonds as your [emergency fund](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vftjBTjFlzI), once the one-year lock-up period has ended.

If you redeem the bonds in less than five years, the last three months of interest will be forfeited. The interest from these bonds is not _pro rata_ if you buy in the middle of a month (e.g., half the month's interest if bought on the 15th). Instead, the government is magnanimous and will provide the full month's interest regardless of when you buy in a given month. The bonds are exempt from state and local taxes, but are subject to federal income tax (unless used for [educational expenses](https://www.thebalance.com/how-to-use-savings-bonds-to-help-pay-for-college-2085509) under certain conditions). You do not pay tax on the interest until the bond is redeemed, unless you [choose to do so](https://thefinancebuff.com/i-bonds-taxes-simple-default.html) early because it benefits your tax situation. To name a beneficiary of the bonds in the event of your death — which you should do for all your accounts — see [this page](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/help/TDHelp/howdoi.htm).

[This explainer](https://thefinancebuff.com/how-to-buy-i-bonds.html) is a good summary of I-bonds and has links to various details. I suggest reading it before starting because the Treasury Direct website has unfortunate quirks. A notable one is that bonds are purchased one business day after you submit the order. So, for instance, if you buy them on the last business day of April — thinking you'll reap the whole month's interest — you'll accidentally purchase them on the first business day of May. For I-bonds, this would also change the interest rate for the first six months, since you would receive the new rate in May rather than the rate from the previous November.

See the [fund proposal section](https://github.com/investindex/Fund/blob/main/README.md#summary) for a summary table of all the suggested bond funds. Additional types of bond funds are discussed in [this footnote](https://github.com/investindex/Fund/blob/main/README.md#f1).

Let's now address how to think through allocation of your investments to stocks and the different types of bonds we just introduced. But first, a brief interlude from our friend, total return.

&nbsp;

## Total return — a reminder

Total return is a straightforward concept: the return provided by a security over a given period of time if you immediately reinvested all distributions. Yet many amateur investors overlook a crucial implication: you cannot judge a fund's returns by its price chart! If I see that Fund ABC had a share price of $100 at the end of 2020, and a share price of $110 at the end of 2021, it's incorrect to assume that its 2021 return was 10%. Virtually all US-listed stock and bond funds have distributions, so price charts always understate performance (unless the period of interest is so short that it occurs between quarterly or monthly dividends). You can check any fund's webpage to see its total return, or you can use tools like [Portfolio Visualizer](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com). The [asset allocation backtest](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-asset-class-allocation) tool lets you compare the total returns of various asset classes, and the [portfolio backtest](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio) tool lets you compare the total returns of specific securities.

Another mistake someone can make with a price chart is to use it to judge the duration of a [drawdown](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/drawdown.asp). Price charts always exaggerate the amount of time it took for an investor to recover from unrealized losses — this will be important below.

Remember: total return is the key performance metric because it reflects the actual experience of an investor.

&nbsp;

## Allocation and overall risk

One way of assessing how you should distribute your risk is considering what your worst-case scenario would be given a possible distribution. First consider what could go wrong in your life anytime: a totaled car, a health crisis, an unexpected home repair, loss of your income or the income of anyone who might depend on you. Then consider that something like this might happen around the same time that your investments drop significantly in value. This would be unlucky, but your financial planning should account for it.

Another risk to consider is the possibility of not meeting your basic needs and personal goals in the long run. You could keep everything in short-term bonds for decades and never suffer a major loss, but the missed opportunities would be vast. Your approach should not be so conservative that it fails to provide you with enough money throughout your working life or during [retirement](https://github.com/investindex/Retirement).

Note the tension between these considerations. Envisioning your long-term goals will push you toward more risk and return, whereas recalling the possibility of loss in the short term will remind you to approach risk carefully.

#### Preparing for loss

How risky are stocks and bonds? The risk presented by individual stocks and by a diversified stock portfolio are fundamentally different. A single stock can lose nearly all of its value and never recover. A diversified index fund or group of funds tracking the global stock market will eventually rebound from downturns. The crucial difference is that a diversified investor need not worry about unrecoverable losses if they have the financial and psychological means to simply wait. So the primary concern is better thought of as volatility rather than loss, because however terrifying it may be, unrealized loss is temporary for a diversified stockholder.

Volatility is routine in the stock market. In October 1989, for instance, the S&P 500 began a [drawdown](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/drawdown.asp) of 7.3% that reached its bottom four weeks later. Recovery above the previous peak occurred in January 1990. This period of unrealized loss lasted less than three months and was an unremarkable event. Minor drawdowns like these are common and relatively easy to experience. In February and March 2020, the S&P 500 crashed by 34% due to COVID-19. In spite of such a rapid and brutal drawdown, it took only until August 2020 for the S&P 500 to exceed its previous peak. Less commonly, this process can also take several years. The 55% decline beginning in October 2007 lasted until March 2009, and persistent recovery above the previous peak did not arrive until August 2012, nearly five years after the drawdown began. The global financial crisis of 2008 was not the only deep, extended period of loss in modern history: a [bear market](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bearmarket.asp) starting in January 1973 did not see its bottom until October 1974 — a 47% loss — or a persistent recovery until May 1978, for a total of more than five years. A drawdown of similar depth occurred in the early 2000s, with recovery by 2006.<sup id="fn5">[[5]](#f5)</sup> Keep in mind that the bear markets in 1973-74, 2000-02, and 2007-09 were unusually severe; only the Great Depression was deeper. The take-home message is that periods of major unrealized loss vary greatly, and this uncertainty is part of the psychological struggle. Participation in the stock market means being prepared for a multiyear period in which returns are zero.

&nbsp;

There are two positive notes to counterbalance this bleak reminder. First, as disastrous as these bear markets might seem in the midst of them, the period we reviewed from 1980 to 2020 included numerous bear markets and still emerged with fantastic overall returns. Second, [diversification](https://github.com/investindex/Portfolio#moving-beyond-market-cap-weighting) can significantly reduce the duration of these drawdowns, compared to a portfolio of only the S&P 500 or only the total market. US small cap value stocks recovered from the 1970s bear market a couple years earlier than the S&P 500, and their overall performance by the end of the decade [crushed](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-asset-class-allocation?s=y&mode=1&timePeriod=4&startYear=1973&firstMonth=1&endYear=1979&lastMonth=12&calendarAligned=true&includeYTD=false&initialAmount=10000&annualOperation=0&annualAdjustment=0&inflationAdjusted=true&annualPercentage=0.0&frequency=4&rebalanceType=1&absoluteDeviation=5.0&relativeDeviation=25.0&leverageType=0&leverageRatio=0.0&debtAmount=0&debtInterest=0.0&maintenanceMargin=25.0&leveragedBenchmark=false&portfolioNames=false&portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&asset1=LargeCapBlend&allocation1_1=100&asset2=TotalStockMarket&allocation2_2=100&asset3=SmallCapValue&allocation3_3=100) the performance of large cap stocks (like the S&P 500). The 1970s would have been a decade of strong growth for someone who highly overweighted small cap value stocks. The [section on stock portfolios](https://github.com/investindex/Portfolio) will expand on risk factor diversification and explain the term "small cap value".

Disasters for long-term bonds are comparatively mild. The market values of bonds, especially those of long-term bonds, are sensitive to changes in interest rates. Take BlackRock's long-term bond ETF ([ILTB](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239424/ishares-core-longterm-us-bond-etf)) as an example. The worst drawdown for long-term bonds in modern US history is occurring right now: ILTB has declined by 24.3% between August 2020 and May 2022. [TLT](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239454/ishares-20-year-treasury-bond-etf) holds treasury bonds with more than 20 years to maturity, so its interest rate risk is very high. TLT's total return chart peaked on Aug 4 2020 and has so far fallen as much as 30.8% by May 5 2022.<sup id="fn6">[[6]](#f6)</sup> If history is any guide, recovery is likely to occur within one to two years of the bottom (but we don't yet know what the bottom is). Potential reduction of drawdowns is one reason to diversify across both government and corporate bonds.

For high-yield bonds, the 2008 financial crisis was the worst period in modern US history. Between May and November 2008, [HYG](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239565/ishares-iboxx-high-yield-corporate-bond-etf) experienced a drawdown of 33.0%, and recovered by September 2009. During the early COVID-19 pandemic, when US financial markets experienced a rapid contraction and expansion, [USHY](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/291299/) and [SHYG](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/258100/ishares-05-year-high-yield-corporate-bond-etf) drew down by 21.6% and 18.4%, respectively, between February and March 2020. They recovered quickly by November 2020.

#### Learning from history

We've reviewed some of the worst experiences for US stocks and bonds, like the 2008 financial crisis and the current nose-dive in bond prices. Such events are expected to be rare, and they are not characteristic of an overwhelming majority of declines in value for stock or long-term bond indices. In particular, many people argue that US financial markets are far more transparent and better-regulated than during the Great Depression era, and that an enduring collapse like that one is inconceivable now.<sup id="fn7">[[7]](#f7)</sup> Until the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, publicly traded companies were [not required](https://github.com/investindex/Risk/blob/main/SecAct1934.pdf) to disclose information to the public, arguably facilitating the wild speculation of the 1920s. I am tempted to agree that a similar crash is unlikely to occur in developed countries. In his [book on retirement](https://libgen.rs/search.php?req=Swedroe+Grogan+Your+Complete+Guide+to+a+Successful+and+Secure+Retirement&open=0&res=25&view=simple&phrase=1&column=def), Larry Swedroe used 60% as the potential drawdown of stocks for which you should be prepared. This is a reasonable guideline for a highly diversified portfolio (but not a portfolio of ten stocks). However, it cannot be ruled out that US or global stocks could fall by more than 60%. Based on the historical data, I will suggest the following disaster scenarios for financial planning:

* a 5% [drawdown](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/drawdown.asp) for short-term bonds
* a 12.5% drawdown for intermediate-term bonds / aggregate bond funds
* a 25% drawdown for long-term bonds
* a 35% drawdown for 20+ year treasuries like [TLT](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239454/ishares-20-year-treasury-bond-etf)
* a 35-40% drawdown for high-yield bonds
* a 60-80% drawdown for the stock market

Could all of these drawdowns happen at the same time? Large declines in the value of stocks and high-quality bonds are unlikely to co-occur for very long. In the event of a bear market, the Federal Reserve tends to lower interest rates to encourage borrowing and spending, which boosts long-term bonds. So it may be most realistic to work out your financial situation if you needed to draw on your investments at the bottom of a 60-80% decline in stocks _or_ the suggested declines in various types of high-quality bonds. Bonds with high credit risk are in particular jeopardy when the stock market plummets, so drawdowns of high-yield bonds should be mentally grouped with those of stocks, not other bonds. Keep in mind that this is a rule of thumb optimizing for simplicity, and other reasonable rules exist. The guideline is deliberately conservative, so a vast majority of future drawdowns will not approach these extremes. As discussed in the [first footnote](https://github.com/investindex/Risk#f1), wars and revolutions have caused the stock markets of individual countries to collapse. For US investors this concern is not especially salient in the domestic market, but it speaks to the merits of geographic diversification. The disasters in US history do not reflect the full range of possibilities.

## Further lessons on risk

### Financial markets are prediction machines, not mirrors of current events

If Mark Zuckerberg announced that in six months, he will direct his company to buy a billion dollars of [collectible beanie babies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yc74wAYVVM) as an investment, [the company's stock](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/FB) would likely fall. Notice that the reaction would not wait for the purchase to occur six months later; the stock price would fall in _anticipation_ of the poor business decision. This is what it means for an event to be "priced in".

For the sake of simplicity, I've used language like "bond prices fall when interest rates rise". A more accurate phrasing would be: "Bond prices fall when expectations change in the direction of interest rates rising (including rising more than previously anticipated)." This situation occurred recently: even though the Federal Reserve did not increase [interest rates](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/federalfundsrate.asp) until March 16, bond prices fell significantly prior to that date. The total return chart of [AGG](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239458/ishares-core-total-us-bond-market-etf) shows a 12.1% drawdown from Aug 6 2020 to May 5 2022, the worst for the US bond market in at least 60 years. This is because the Federal Reserve signaled that it will raise rates more aggressively than previously planned, in response to [unexpected inflation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inflationrisk.asp). In [late April](https://www.wsj.com/articles/feds-powell-could-seal-expectations-of-half-point-rate-rise-in-may-11650533444), additional warnings of larger rate hikes led bond prices to fall further. Bond markets reacted in _anticipation_ of those interest rate hikes; they did not react to them in real time.

The same lesson applies to economic recessions: some people become upset when the stock market starts booming in the middle of a recession, declaring the stock market to be disconnected from the economic struggles of real people. When the stock market begins recovering, it reflects a prediction that further unexpected bad news is unlikely to persist, and economic recovery is on the horizon. See [this footnote](https://github.com/investindex/Risk#f4) for another example.

&nbsp;

### Two broad types of risk

It is probably not surprising to read that there are smart and dumb ways to take investment risks. Some people seem to find it entertaining to embrace catastrophic risk and and suffer [crippling financial losses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UY0uS6Z6oE). These smart and dumb types of risk are referred to as "compensated" and "uncompensated" risk, respectively. For example, it is riskier to own shares of a globally diversified [fund](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/vt) of stocks than a globally diversified [fund](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/bndw) of bonds. Why are many investors willing to hold stocks despite their greater risk? Because stockholders are _compensated_ for this elevated risk with higher expected return than bondholders. Accepting risk that increases expected return means you are taking a compensated risk.

A primary way in which many people assume uncompensated risk is by picking stocks on their own and holding small numbers of stocks. This exposes them to idiosyncratic risks of individual stocks, for which they are not compensated. The general solution to uncompensated risk is diversification — a portfolio of thousands of stocks has nearly eliminated idiosyncratic risk. If you want more uncompensated risk, there are many options: short selling [volatile biotech stocks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80BXR4zX2EE), getting [too much leverage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMO42qkPiio) with total return swaps, or buying short-term, out-of-the-money options. If you don't know what these mean, that's for the best. It should be the goal of an investor to create a portfolio with the appropriate level of risk, and to assume only compensated risks.

&nbsp;

### Are you a stock or a bond?

That's the title of a well-known [book](https://libgen.rs/search.php?req=Milevsky+Are+you+a+stock+or+a+bond%3F&lg_topic=libgen&open=0&view=simple&res=25&phrase=1&column=def) by Moshe Milevsky. The question refers to the risk of your human capital, also known as labor capital. Your ability to earn income is an enormous asset, and the stability of the cash flow produced by this asset is an important part of the risk you can accept in financial markets. The classic example of a bond-like person is a tenured university professor, who likely has high job security and uniform income across time. A person with stock-like human capital, in contrast, might be a commissioned salesperson in a volatile industry. He is at risk of losing income or losing his job altogether in adverse economic conditions. Even if the professor and salesperson have the same average income and the same expenses, the professor can afford to embrace more risk in her portfolio, because her human capital generates a stable, bond-like cash flow. The salesperson would need to have a higher risk tolerance to hold the same ratio of stocks to bonds in his brokerage account. If income or job security in someone's line of work is strongly related to the fortunes of the stock market, they should be [especially eager](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2018/08/23/are-you-a-stock-or-a-bond) to hold more bonds. [This podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrL2BR0MNM&t=1499s) discusses how the types of risk in your portfolio can complement the economic risks to which you're personally exposed (and see [this section](https://github.com/investindex/Portfolio) for full explanation).

&nbsp;

### Rebalancing — risk maintenance

The primary influence on the risk of a portfolio is its allocation of stocks and bonds. An 80/20 portfolio — with 80% stocks and 20% bonds — is far riskier than a 20/80 portfolio, with 20% stocks and 80% bonds. Secondarily, the risk-return characteristics are affected by allocation to different stock and bond funds within the two broad categories. As discussed above, bond funds vary in risk based on a combination of term risk and credit risk.

Over time, some portions of a portfolio will depart from their initial allocation. During a [bull market](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bullmarket.asp), in which stock returns are generally positive, stock funds tend to become overweighted. During a [bear market](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bearmarket.asp), in which stock returns are persistently negative, bond funds tend to become overweighted. When weights of different funds drift from their initial weights, the portfolio's risk-return profile changes. The solution to this drift is [rebalancing](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rebalancing.asp), which conserves the portfolio's intended risk level.

The most straightforward method of rebalancing is to sell shares in overweighted funds and use the cash to buy shares in underweighted funds. For example, an 80/20 allocation might drift to 83/17 during a long bull market. To restore the intended risk-return characteristics, we would sell shares of stock funds and buy shares of bond funds. The mechanics of rebalancing are covered in the [section on practical information](https://github.com/investindex/Practical#dividends-and-rebalancing).

&nbsp;

## Summary

Investment risk has two components: loss due to risk you took, and missed opportunities due to risk you didn’t take. Careful planning helps you balance them. In particular, the stock market provides stunning returns in the long term, but presents the risk of significant loss in the short term. Risk of short-term loss can be dialed down by investing in bonds with differing characteristics, the lowest risk being in short-term US treasury bonds. Not only do bonds have less volatility overall, but bonds with high credit quality can (but do not always) offset losses when stocks plummet. In contrast, high-yield bonds tend to fall with stocks. Risk that increases expected return is called compensated risk. Rebalancing is how you conserve the risk and expected return of your portfolio. Financial markets do not react to events in real time; they react to changing expectations about the future.

Footnotes:

<sup id="f1"> 1 </sup> What are realistic expectations for stock market returns? First we should understand inflation. It will become evident in the section on [retirement planning](https://github.com/investindex/Retirement) that returns after accounting for inflation are what matter to long-term investors. Your return before inflation is called the "nominal return", and your return after inflation is called the "real return". Imagine a 10% average annual return over some number of years, accompanied by average annual inflation of 3.5%. To correctly calculate the real return, we need to convert these percentage changes to multipliers. The nominal return of 10% as a multiplier is 1.1, and 3.5% inflation as a multiplier is 1.035, so the real return as a multiplier is 1.1/1.035 = 1.0628, which is a 6.28% real return. There are other paths to the same real return: 7.34% nominal return and 1% inflation provides a real return of 1.0734/1.01 = 1.0628, again 6.28%.

What are average stock market returns in real terms (i.e., after inflation)? I will use data from the summary of the [Credit Suisse Global Investment Returns Yearbook 2021](https://www.credit-suisse.com/media/assets/corporate/docs/about-us/research/publications/credit-suisse-global-investment-returns-yearbook-2021-summary-edition.pdf), which contains data from 1900 through 2020. Globally, the average annual real return was 5.3% (in US dollar terms; Figure 38). After excluding hyperinflation events in Germany and Austria in the early 1920s, average annual inflation was 2.6% (Figure 5). This implies an average nominal return of about 8.0%. The average real return in the US was 6.6%, with an average nominal return of nearly 10%.

The superior results of the US market were partially caused by the lack of widespread physical or political devastation since 1900. Japanese stocks lost 97% of value and bonds lost 99% of value due to World War II (in US dollar terms; pp. 38, 40). The stock markets of Russia and China closed down in 1917 and 1949, respectively, due to their communist revolutions. Stock- and bondholders experienced virtually total loss and markets did not reopen for decades. The global average of 5.3% real annual returns includes catastrophic losses like these.

Although the US had exceptional performance in the past, exceeded by only Australia and South Africa, this does not imply that we can expect the US to outperform the rest of the world over the next several decades. To paraphrase Cliff Asness, [the long run can lie to you](https://www.aqr.com/Insights/Perspectives/The-Long-Run-Is-Lying-to-You). He showed in the linked article that US outperformance of international stocks from 1980 to 2020 was due almost entirely to higher growth in valuations rather than higher growth in fundamentals. That is, US companies did not experience significantly greater growth per share in fundamentals like earnings, but US stocks became more expensive than international stocks. There are some long-run trends we have good reason to think will persist, like stocks outperforming bonds, but this is not one of them. Simply observing that something has occurred over a long period of time is not a valid justification for assuming that it will continue to occur. [↩](#fn1)

&nbsp;

<sup id="f2"> 2 </sup> For funds with minimal risk that _still_ usually have higher returns than money market funds, see ultrashort-term bond funds which hold bonds with an average remaining maturity of one year or less, such as [VUSB](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/vusb), [SHV](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239466/ishares-short-treasury-bond-etf), [ULST](https://www.ssga.com/us/en/individual/etfs/funds/spdr-ssga-ultra-short-term-bond-etf-ulst), [BILS](https://www.ssga.com/us/en/individual/etfs/funds/spdr-bloomberg-barclays-3-12-month-t-bill-etf-bils), and [CLTL](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=CLTL). [SGOV](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/314116/ishares-0-3-month-treasury-bond-etf) and [BIL](https://www.ssga.com/us/en/individual/etfs/funds/spdr-bloomberg-barclays-1-3-month-t-bill-etf-bil) approximate the risk-free rate of return by investing in US treasury bonds with remaining maturities of three months or less. [↩](#fn2)

&nbsp;

<sup id="f3"> 3 </sup> Another level deeper in understanding bonds involves the term [_convexity_](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/convexity.asp). [Duration](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/duration.asp) expresses the rate at which a bond's market value changes in response to a given change in interest rates. It measures interest rate sensitivity. Convexity expresses the rate at which a bond's duration changes in response to a given change in interest rates. For those familiar with calculus, duration is the first derivative of market value with respect to interest rate, and convexity is the second derivative. A good explanation of these concepts is in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2h361u2byo&t=3252s). Bond portfolios with the same average duration can have different expected responses to changes in the [yield curve](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/y/yieldcurve.asp), and this is expressed by convexity. To put it more concretely, the properties of a portfolio split between short-term and long-term bonds are different than those of a portfolio of intermediate-term bonds with the same average duration. The former is called a barbell portfolio (heavy on short and long), while the latter is called a bullet portfolio.

In addition to interest rate risk, the other primary driver of term risk is the [risk of unexpected inflation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inflationrisk.asp). If the market price of a bond with a fixed coupon rate is based on an implicit assumption of 3% inflation, and inflation unexpectedly rises to 8% before the bond's maturity, this would cause the bond's coupon payments to be worth less in real (i.e., inflation-adjusted) terms. [↩](#fn3)

&nbsp;

<sup id="f4"> 4 </sup> The US Treasury issues Series I savings bonds to help US citizens and residents cope with inflation. It also issues treasury inflation-protected securities ([TIPS](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tips.asp)), which are marketable bonds in contrast to savings bonds. They are sometimes misunderstood as providing the same kind of protection against inflation that I-bonds do. Coupon payments from a TIP security increase as inflation rises and decrease as inflation falls. The face value also changes with inflation. But a TIP security is not an inherently better investment than a fixed-rate bond during high inflation. If inflation were consistently 9%, buying a TIP security would be unlikely to benefit you compared to buying a fixed-rate treasury bond with the same maturity date. Buying a TIP security should be done to express a prediction that _unexpected_ inflation will cause the value of the bond to increase. It can also be purchased as a general hedge against unexpected inflation, without a specific prediction that unexpected inflation will occur soon. TIP security funds are listed in [this footnote](https://github.com/investindex/Fund/blob/main/README.md#f1). [↩](#fn4)

(There was also a peak on Mar 24 2000 with a value of 99.93% that of the peak on Sep 1. This extends the period of unrealized loss from six years and two months to six years and seven months.)

The 2000s were disappointing because the combination of two severe bear markets led to extended periods of zero return. How far can we go back and still find a higher value than the bottom of the Great Recession on Mar 9 2009? May 5 1997 — nearly 12 years. And how far forward do we need to move before we permanently exceed the peak reached on Mar 24 2000? This finally happens on Dec 21 2010, well over ten years later. Note that this does not mean 12 years of investing would have turned out useless: there is no way to reliably time the market and sell at a peak like Mar 24 2000, or buy at the bottom of a trough like Mar 9 2009.

Calculations for the 1989-90 drawdown, 2020 crash, Great Recession, and 2000-2002 bear market relied on values of the [S&P 500 total return](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5ESP500TR) from Yahoo! Finance. Using the [S&P 500 price](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EGSPC) ignores dividends. This leads to exaggeration of bear markets, especially when calculating the time between nadir and recovery to previous peak. Calculations for the duration of the 1970s drawdown relied on [this calculator](https://dqydj.com/sp-500-return-calculator), which uses Robert Shiller's [data](http://www.econ.yale.edu/~shiller/data.htm). The drawdown estimate of 47% relied on the S&P 500 price on Oct 3 1974, because distortions due to omitting dividends are mild on the downward half. The price chart had a drawdown of 48%, from which I subtracted one percentage point, based on similar differences during other long drawdowns. [↩](#fn5)

<sup id="f7"> 7 </sup> How bad was the Great Depression? A seemingly widespread misconception among those who read about investing is that the US stock market took 25 years to recover from the crash that started in 1929. It's true that the prices of the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the predecessor to the S&P 500 didn't recover to their 1929 peaks until 1954. But as stated in the footnote above, this is a misleading and often very incorrect way of computing the duration of a drawdown. Price charts do not include dividends, which means they always understate performance in terms of total return. On top of this, the Great Depression was a highly deflationary period. Most bear markets are extended if you account for inflation, but the Great Depression is exaggerated by neglecting deflation. After factoring in dividends and deflation, we can use [this calculator](https://dqydj.com/sp-500-return-calculator) based on Robert Shiller's [data](http://www.econ.yale.edu/~shiller/data.htm) to see that the drawdown beginning in Sep 1929 lasted only about seven years (until Nov 1936). Nominally — that is, without accounting for deflation — the drawdown lasted about 15 years (until Jan 1945, roughly). The nadir of the drawdown was in June 1932 at a loss of slightly over 80%.
