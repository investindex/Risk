# Thinking about risk

“How should I invest my money?” is a question that cannot be avoided — to invest none of it is a tacit decision. Any good answer would be highly personalized, but the right information about risk can help anyone think about this question.

In the context of investment, one can consider risk of loss on a spectrum: some securities can safely be considered to carry no risk, like [certificates of deposit](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/certificateofdeposit.asp); some have moderate risk, such as diversified stock funds; and others carry high risk, such as [hedge fund purchases of distressed debt](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/bonds/08/distressed-debt-hedge-fund.asp). The lowest-risk options generate small returns and, in the current low-interest environment, will not even keep pace with inflation. Stock market index funds require the investor to accept meaningful risk, with the potential for much greater reward.

What do lifetime returns from index funds look like? According to [this article](https://www.wsj.com/articles/lessons-from-a-crazy-year-in-financial-markets-11609410602), placing $10,000 in an S&P 500 index fund in Jan 1980 with dividend reinvestments would have yielded nearly $700,000 of growth by August 2020. This is an impressive reward for leaving money alone, especially in contrast to any low-risk alternative. The average annual return was [just over 11%](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%28707421%2F10000%29%5E%281%2F%2840%2B2%2F3%29%29). Now imagine a different scenario, in which you added savings to a [tax-advantaged retirement account](https://github.com/investindex/Guidelines#tax-advantaged-accounts) at the beginning of every year. You started with $1,000 in 1980 and increased by $100 each year through 2020. For simplicity, imagine that your investment grew at the average rate the whole time. By the end of August 2020 you contributed [$123,000](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=Sum%5B1000%2B100n%2C+%7Bn%2C+0%2C+40%7D%5D) but your account reached a value of about [$1.3 million](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=Sum%5B%281000%2B100n%29*1.1104113%5E%282%2F3%2B40-n%29%2C+%7Bn%2C+0%2C+40%7D%5D). These examples are simplistic but exhibit the power of compounding growth.

</p>

We can’t be sure what future returns will be — don't count on 11%, which is unusually high.<sup id="fn1">[1](#f1)</sup> Between 1980 and 2020, the returns during many individual months and even several calendar years were negative. Most years yielded returns that deviated significantly from the average: returns such as +20% or -10% should be part of expectations. See the plot below, which displays calendar year returns in the US [stock](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-asset-class-allocation?s=y&mode=1&timePeriod=4&startYear=2000&firstMonth=1&endYear=2021&lastMonth=12&calendarAligned=true&includeYTD=false&initialAmount=10000&annualOperation=0&annualAdjustment=0&inflationAdjusted=true&annualPercentage=0.0&frequency=4&rebalanceType=1&absoluteDeviation=5.0&relativeDeviation=25.0&leverageType=0&leverageRatio=0.0&debtAmount=0&debtInterest=0.0&maintenanceMargin=25.0&leveragedBenchmark=false&portfolioNames=false&portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&asset1=TotalStockMarket&allocation1_1=100) and [bond](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-asset-class-allocation?s=y&mode=1&timePeriod=4&startYear=2000&firstMonth=1&endYear=2021&lastMonth=12&calendarAligned=true&includeYTD=false&initialAmount=10000&annualOperation=0&annualAdjustment=0&inflationAdjusted=true&annualPercentage=0.0&frequency=4&rebalanceType=1&absoluteDeviation=5.0&relativeDeviation=25.0&leverageType=0&leverageRatio=0.0&debtAmount=0&debtInterest=0.0&maintenanceMargin=25.0&leveragedBenchmark=false&portfolioNames=false&portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&asset1=TotalBond&allocation1_1=100) markets since 2000. Note how far most of the annual stock returns fall from the average (the purple diamond). The returns for US aggregate bonds cluster more closely around the average, but in exchange for the benefit of reduced volatility, the average return is lower.

In this period of 22 calendar years, a negative bond return occured in 14% of years, and a negative stock return in 23% of years. Viewing only annual returns obscures a lot of volatility — we can zoom in on monthly returns. About 33% of months for bonds and 35% of months for stocks were negative. We can even [estimate](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5ESP500TR) what portion of days were negative in the US stock market: about 46%. This illustrates one of the essential lessons of investing in volatile assets: returns in the short term have a considerable probability of being negative — a single day is nearly a coin flip. But diversified investors can be assured that as they invest over long periods, their probability of reaping a positive return creeps up toward 100%. See [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhYHrHiOS_E) for a great explanation of this.

## Understanding bonds and their risks

How can you invest money that can’t be exposed to the volatility of the stock market? A primary way of doing this is through [bonds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bond.asp). Most people know that banks make money by providing people with loans in exchange for repayment with interest. Like banks, you can invest in debt through bonds, also known as fixed income. Bonds are liquid assets and can be traded, although not as easily as stocks. Anyone can invest in government and corporate bonds through an ETF or mutual fund. Some examples of large bond issuers include the federal US government, Microsoft, Bank of America, and Boeing. A bond fund purchases many bonds representing debt on the part of each bond issuer, and the bond issuers pay the fund. Payments from the bond issuer to the bondholder are called [coupon payments](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/coupon.asp), and they usually occur semi-annually. The payments are complete for a particular bond when it reaches maturity. Upon maturity, the issuer pays back the amount they originally borrowed, an amount which is called the face value of the bond. Funds pass on these payments to shareholders in the form of cash dividends. The fund's share price corresponds to the market value of the bonds.

Bonds have less risk and less long-term return than stocks. This is partly because, if a company declares bankruptcy, the bondholders' claim to company assets takes priority over that of common stockholders. If a bond issuer is unable to pay their debt, this is referred to as [default](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/defaultrisk.asp). Bonds which are less likely to be paid back in full command higher returns to accompany their risk. Government bonds are considered less risky than corporate bonds. Corporate bonds are divided into two broad categories based on [credit quality](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditquality.asp): investment-grade bonds (with comparatively low risk) and [high-yield bonds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/high_yield_bond.asp) (also known as junk bonds).

Bonds present two dimensions of risk.

Longer-term bonds are riskier than shorter-term bonds. A primary reason is that longer-term bonds are more sensitive to the risk of interest rates rising, simply called [interest rate risk](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestraterisk.asp). Rising interest rates cause existing bonds to fall in value because terms of payment for the bondholders become less attractive than those of new bonds with higher interest payments. A decline in interest rates would be a boon to the market value of bonds, especially long-term bonds, but interest rates are already at historically low levels. It's important to stress that changes in interest rates do not affect the income from existing bonds. They affect the market value of existing bonds, which corresponds to a fund's share price. Although not a strict prerequisite for investing in bonds, understanding the concept of bond [duration](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/duration.asp) will improve your appreciation for how interest rates affect bond valuation.<sup id="fn3">[3](#f3)</sup>

The second type of risk is credit risk, which encompasses (a) the risk that [defaults](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/defaultrisk.asp) on debt will increase unexpectedly as well as (b) the risk that credit ratings of the bond issuers will be [downgraded](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/022615/what-types-financial-situations-would-credit-spread-risk-be-applied-instead-default-risk.asp). These are usually referred to as _default risk_ and _credit migration risk_, respectively. Upgrading or downgrading of a bond issuer's credit rating changes the market value of the bond but not the income. Default means a bond issuer has missed payments, which has obvious negative effects on both income from the bond as well as its market value. High-yield bonds provide higher long-term return because the issuers have poor credit quality, and they must compensate investors for accepting a greater risk of default (relative to investment-grade corporate bond issuers). US Treasury bonds are among the safest in the world, so their risk and return are comparatively low.

Long-term bonds are typically defined as those with 10-30 years until maturity. Intermediate-term may be defined as 3-10 or 5-10 years, and short-term may be defined as 1-3 or 1-5 years. Bonds called ultrashort-term usually have about 1 year or less until maturity.

Bond funds typically pay monthly dividends. The best default for most people is to automatically reinvest these dividends in more shares of the fund. When you need to withdraw money from the fund, you could turn off automatic reinvestment and wait for the next dividend payment. However, selling shares of the fund is more likely to be suitable both in terms of timing and the dollar amount you need. See the [section on taxes](https://github.com/investindex/Taxes) for the different tax implications these actions carry. I mentioned previously that stock ETFs are more tax-efficient than stock mutual funds, but the distinction does not apply as strongly to bond funds. This is because unlike stock ETFs, bond ETFs sometimes need to [distribute capital gains](https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/investment-products/etf/etfs-tax-efficiency). So for instance, someone investing in bonds in a taxable Schwab brokerage account has little tax-related incentive to prefer the ETF [SCHZ](https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/products/schz) to the mutual fund [SWAGX](https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/products/swagx). As long as buying shares of SWAGX does not entail a fee — which it does not because this person is using a Schwab account — they may prefer SWAGX because it allows them to invest a precise dollar amount.

How do bond funds fit into your portfolio?

### Investing in bonds and navigating the spectrum of risk

I will provide at least one example of each type of bond fund as I review them. The default will be a fund from BlackRock, simply because they have a great display in which you can easily view the total return starting and ending at any date (for example, see [AGG](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239458/ishares-core-total-us-bond-market-etf)). It shows how an initial investment of $10,000 would have changed in value over time, and I encourage you to click on a fund from each paragraph to see its total return over the history of the fund. This will give you an idea of the fund's possible future behavior, although keep in mind that no fund currently in operation has a history long enough to show the full range of possibilities. Later in this section, we'll discuss historical examples of extreme scenarios.

We can think about the role of bonds by walking through layers of risk and return. First is your checking account, which holds money you anticipate using in the immediate future. A checking account has zero risk and zero return. What could you do to generate modest returns for the money you don’t need at your fingertips, without exposing it to substantial risk? The most straightforward candidate is a fund with high-quality, short-term bonds. This is a place for slow, safe growth. It can hold money you anticipate needing in the next one to two years. Close to rock bottom for the slowest, safest growth is a short-term US treasury bond fund (e.g., [SHY](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239452/ishares-13-year-treasury-bond-etf)). There are also broader short-term funds with both government and corporate bonds, like [BSV](https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/overview/BSV) and [AVSF](https://www.avantisinvestors.com/content/avantis/en/investments/avantis-short-term-fixed-income-etf.html). Returns from short-term bond funds may seem trivial, but they become impressive in the long run and are generally better than returns from a savings account, [money market fund](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/money-marketfund.asp), or certificate of deposit.<sup id="fn2">[2](#f2)</sup> Any portion can be promptly withdrawn when you need it.

Behind your short-term bonds should be intermediate- and long-term bonds. Here you could hold part of the money reserved for periods beyond the nearest future but in the next two to eight years. Intermediate-term funds include [IMTB](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/285539/ishares-core-5-10-year-usd-bond-etf) and long-term funds include [ILTB](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239424/ishares-core-longterm-us-bond-etf). Due to their high risk, long-term bonds have high expected return and can even beat stocks over extended periods. Long-term treasury bonds (e.g., [VGLT](https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/VGLT)) in particular have low correlation to stocks, providing a [diversification](https://github.com/investindex/Portfolio#clarifying-diversification) benefit. However, due to low interest rates, the near-term outlook for bonds is not as bright as it was in the past, so we can't expect a repeat of the [performance](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-asset-class-allocation?s=y&mode=1&timePeriod=4&startYear=1978&firstMonth=1&endYear=2008&lastMonth=12&calendarAligned=true&includeYTD=false&initialAmount=10000&annualOperation=0&annualAdjustment=0&inflationAdjusted=true&annualPercentage=0.0&frequency=4&rebalanceType=1&absoluteDeviation=5.0&relativeDeviation=25.0&leverageType=0&leverageRatio=0.0&debtAmount=0&debtInterest=0.0&maintenanceMargin=25.0&leveragedBenchmark=false&portfolioNames=false&portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&asset1=TreasuryNotes&allocation1_1=100&asset2=LongTreasury&allocation2_2=100&asset3=LongCorpBond&allocation3_3=100) from the last several decades. This kind of forecast is not possible to make where stocks are concerned — at least not with any confidence — but the future returns of bonds are more predictable. [In](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/TB3MS) [the](https://www.macrotrends.net/2015/fed-funds-rate-historical-chart) [1980s](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-asset-class-allocation?s=y&mode=1&timePeriod=4&startYear=1978&firstMonth=1&endYear=1995&lastMonth=12&calendarAligned=true&includeYTD=false&initialAmount=10000&annualOperation=0&annualAdjustment=0&inflationAdjusted=true&annualPercentage=0.0&frequency=4&rebalanceType=1&absoluteDeviation=5.0&relativeDeviation=25.0&leverageType=0&leverageRatio=0.0&debtAmount=0&debtInterest=0.0&maintenanceMargin=25.0&leveragedBenchmark=false&portfolioNames=false&portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&asset1=TreasuryBills&allocation1_1=100&asset2=ShortTreasury&allocation2_2=100&asset3=LongTreasury&allocation3_3=100), you could hold even short-term treasury bonds and collect a good return with low risk. However, you would pay [very high](https://www.macrotrends.net/2604/30-year-fixed-mortgage-rate-chart) interest rates as a borrower — perhaps 13% on your home mortgage — and inflation was high. Bonds still function as risk control, of course, but can't contribute to returns in the same way.

If you’d prefer only one bond fund, you could buy shares of a fund with bonds of maturities balanced between short, intermediate, and long. If someone says they are invested in "bonds" rather vaguely, they're probably invested in a fund like this. These aggregate bond market funds are usually a US bond fund (e.g., [AGG](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239458/ishares-core-total-us-bond-market-etf)) or a combination of US and international funds ([BNDW](https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/overview/BNDW)). They can also be a US treasury bond fund (e.g., [GOVT](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239468/ishares-us-treasury-bond-etf)) or a US corporate bond fund (e.g., [LQD](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239566/ishares-iboxx-investment-grade-corporate-bond-etf)). Your distribution of bond maturities, and the overall risk-return profile, may not be ideal, but for many people aggregate funds strike a good balance. The interest rate risk levels of these funds are about the same or somewhat higher than those of intermediate-term funds. In addition to government and corporate bonds, aggregate funds contain [mortgage-backed securities](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mbs.asp). These are bonds created by pooling mortgage debt from many people. You don't necessarily need to buy shares in a mortgage-backed securities fund (e.g., [MBB](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239465/ishares-mbs-etf)), but it's useful to understand the different types of debt held in aggregate funds.

Behind your high-quality bonds of various maturities might be high-yield bonds (e.g., [USHY](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/291299/ishares-broad-usd-high-yield-corporate-bond-etf)), issued by companies with low credit ratings. With inception in 1978, [VWEHX](https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/profile/overview/VWEHX) has the [longest history](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-asset-class-allocation?s=y&mode=1&timePeriod=4&startYear=1972&firstMonth=1&endYear=2022&lastMonth=12&calendarAligned=true&includeYTD=false&initialAmount=10000&annualOperation=0&annualAdjustment=0&inflationAdjusted=true&annualPercentage=0.0&frequency=4&rebalanceType=1&absoluteDeviation=5.0&relativeDeviation=25.0&leverageType=0&leverageRatio=0.0&debtAmount=0&debtInterest=0.0&maintenanceMargin=25.0&leveragedBenchmark=false&portfolioNames=false&portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&asset1=HighYield&allocation1_1=100) you can observe, which includes the 2008 financial crisis. Another fund from BlackRock is [SHYG](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/258100/ishares-05-year-high-yield-corporate-bond-etf), which combines low interest rate risk with high credit risk. Be aware that while bonds with high credit quality can act as a countervailing force when stocks crash, high-yield bonds tend to fall along with stocks (by much less). This is because they are issued by companies which are more vulnerable to economic downturns. So they do not occupy the same role as a potential hedge in your portfolio.

See the [fund proposal section](https://github.com/investindex/Fund/blob/main/README.md#summary) for a summary table of all the suggested bond funds.

Finally, behind your bond funds should be the stock index funds introduced at the beginning. They will generate the bulk of your investment returns. The various funds that could form your stock portfolio will be discussed in later sections. First we should address how to think through allocation of your investments to stocks and the different types of bonds we just introduced.

&nbsp;

## Allocation and overall risk

One way of assessing how you should distribute your risk is considering what your worst-case scenario would be given a possible distribution. First consider what could go wrong in your life anytime: a totaled car, a health crisis, an unexpected home repair, loss of your income or the income of anyone who might depend on you. Then consider that something like this might happen around the same time that your investments drop significantly in value. This would be unlucky, but your financial planning should account for it.

Another risk to consider is the possibility of not meeting your basic needs and personal goals in the long run. You could keep everything in short-term bonds for decades and never suffer a major loss, but the missed opportunities would be vast. Your approach should not be so conservative that it fails to provide you with enough money throughout your working life or during [retirement](https://github.com/investindex/Retirement).

Note the tension between these considerations. Envisioning your long-term goals will push you toward more risk and return, whereas recalling the possibility of loss in the short term will remind you to approach risk carefully.

#### Preparing for loss

How risky are stocks and bonds? The risk presented by individual stocks and by a diversified stock portfolio are fundamentally different. A single stock can lose nearly all of its value and never recover. A diversified index fund or group of funds tracking the global stock market will eventually rebound from downturns. The crucial difference is that a diversified investor need not worry about unrecoverable losses if they have the financial and psychological means to simply wait. So the primary concern is better thought of as volatility rather than loss, because however terrifying it may be, unrealized loss is temporary for a diversified stockholder.

Volatility is routine in the stock market. In October 1989, for instance, the S&P 500 began a [drawdown](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/drawdown.asp) of 7.3% that reached its bottom four weeks later. Recovery above the previous peak occurred in January 1990. This period of unrealized loss lasted less than three months and was an unremarkable event. Minor drawdowns like these are common and relatively easy to experience. In February and March 2020, the S&P 500 crashed by 34% due to COVID-19. In spite of such a rapid and brutal drawdown, it took only until August 2020 for the S&P 500 to exceed its previous peak. Less commonly, this process can also take several years. The 55% decline beginning in October 2007 lasted until March 2009, and persistent recovery above the previous peak did not arrive until August 2012, nearly five years after the drawdown began. The global financial crisis of 2008 was not the only deep, extended period of loss in modern history: a [bear market](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bearmarket.asp) starting in January 1973 did not see its bottom until October 1974 — a 48% loss — or a persistent recovery until May 1978, for a total of more than five years. A drawdown of similar depth occurred in the early 2000s.<sup id="fn4">[4](#f4)</sup> Keep in mind that the bear markets in 1973-74, 2000-02, and 2007-09 were unusually severe; only the Great Depression was deeper. The take-home message is that periods of major unrealized loss vary greatly, and this uncertainty is part of the psychological struggle. Participation in the stock market means being prepared for a multiyear period in which returns are zero.

</p>

&nbsp;

There are two positive notes to counterbalance this bleak reminder. First, as disastrous as these bear markets might seem in the midst of them, the period we reviewed from 1980 to 2020 included numerous bear markets and still emerged with fantastic overall returns. Second, [diversification](https://github.com/investindex/Portfolio#moving-beyond-market-cap-weighting) can significantly reduce the duration of these drawdowns, compared to a portfolio of only the S&P 500 or only the total market. US small cap value stocks recovered from the 1970s bear market a couple years earlier than the S&P 500, and their overall performance by the end of the decade [crushed](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-asset-class-allocation?s=y&mode=1&timePeriod=4&startYear=1973&firstMonth=1&endYear=1979&lastMonth=12&calendarAligned=true&includeYTD=false&initialAmount=10000&annualOperation=0&annualAdjustment=0&inflationAdjusted=true&annualPercentage=0.0&frequency=4&rebalanceType=1&absoluteDeviation=5.0&relativeDeviation=25.0&leverageType=0&leverageRatio=0.0&debtAmount=0&debtInterest=0.0&maintenanceMargin=25.0&leveragedBenchmark=false&portfolioNames=false&portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&asset1=LargeCapBlend&allocation1_1=100&asset2=TotalStockMarket&allocation2_2=100&asset3=SmallCapValue&allocation3_3=100) the performance of large cap stocks (like the S&P 500). The 1970s would have been a decade of strong growth for someone who highly overweighted small cap value stocks. The [section on stock portfolios](https://github.com/investindex/Portfolio) will expand on risk factor diversification and explain the term _small cap value_.

Disasters for long-term bonds are comparatively mild. The market values of bonds, especially those of long-term bonds, are sensitive to changes in interest rates. Take BlackRock's long-term bond ETF ([ILTB](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239424/ishares-core-longterm-us-bond-etf)) as an example. 2013 was the [worst year](https://money.cnn.com/2013/12/13/investing/bonds-record-outflow/index.html) of this century for US long-term bonds. ILTB drew down by 14.0% between May and August, recovering by September 2014. [TLT](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239454/ishares-20-year-treasury-bond-etf) — which holds treasury bonds with more than 20 years to maturity, and carries high interest rate risk — suffered even more, declining by 20.1% between July 2012 and August 2013. TLT recovered by December 2014. Drawdowns have the potential to be greater. For someone holding long-term bonds split evenly between corporate and US treasury bonds, the [worst period](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-asset-class-allocation?s=y&mode=1&timePeriod=4&startYear=1979&firstMonth=1&endYear=1982&lastMonth=12&calendarAligned=true&includeYTD=false&initialAmount=10000&annualOperation=0&annualAdjustment=0&inflationAdjusted=true&annualPercentage=0.0&frequency=4&rebalanceType=1&absoluteDeviation=5.0&relativeDeviation=25.0&leverageType=0&leverageRatio=0.0&debtAmount=0&debtInterest=0.0&maintenanceMargin=25.0&leveragedBenchmark=false&portfolioNames=false&portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&asset1=LongTreasury&allocation1_1=100&allocation1_3=50&asset2=LongCorpBond&allocation2_2=100&allocation2_3=50) in modern US history was July 1979 to February 1980 with a loss of 17.6%. Recovery above the previous peak did not occur persistently until March 1982. Long-term treasuries drew down by an even larger 23.1%. Potential reduction of drawdowns is one reason to diversify across both government and corporate bonds.

For high-yield bonds, the 2008 financial crisis was the worst period in modern US history. Between May and November 2008, [HYG](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239565/ishares-iboxx-high-yield-corporate-bond-etf) experienced a drawdown of 33.0%, and recovered by September 2009. During the early COVID-19 pandemic, when US financial markets experienced a rapid contraction and expansion, [USHY](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/291299/) and [SHYG](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/258100/ishares-05-year-high-yield-corporate-bond-etf) drew down by 21.6% and 18.4%, respectively, between February and March 2020. They recovered quickly by November 2020.

#### Learning from history

Based on the historical data, I will suggest the following disaster scenarios for financial planning: a 25% [drawdown](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/drawdown.asp) of long-term bonds or an 80% drawdown of the stock market. Such events are expected to be extremely rare, and they are not characteristic of an overwhelming majority of declines in value for stock or long-term bond indices. In particular, many people argue that US financial markets are far more transparent and better-regulated than during the Great Depression era, and that an enduring collapse like that one is inconceivable now.<sup id="fn5">[5](#f5)</sup> Until the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, publicly traded companies were [not required](https://github.com/investindex/Risk/blob/main/SecAct1934.pdf) to disclose information to the public, arguably facilitating the wild speculation of the 1920s. I am tempted to agree that a similar crash is unlikely to occur in developed countries, but it is hard to agree so completely that I would stake my financial solvency on it. In his [book on retirement](https://libgen.is/search.php?req=Swedroe+Grogan+Your+Complete+Guide+to+a+Successful+and+Secure+Retirement&open=0&res=25&view=simple&phrase=1&column=def), Larry Swedroe used 60% as the potential drawdown of stocks for which you should be prepared. This is also a reasonable guideline.

Could both of these drawdowns happen at the same time? Large declines in the value of stocks and long-term bonds are unlikely to co-occur for very long. In the event of a bear market, the Federal Reserve tends to lower interest rates to encourage borrowing and spending, which boosts long-term bonds. So it may be most realistic to work out your financial situation if you needed to draw on your investments at the bottom of a 60-80% decline in stocks _or_ a 25% decline in long-term bonds. For potential drawdowns of other bond funds, I will suggest a 5% drawdown for short-term bonds, a 12% drawdown for intermediate-term bonds / aggregate bond funds, and a 35-40% drawdown for high-yield bonds. Corporate bonds with high credit risk are in particular jeopardy when the stock market plummets, so drawdowns of high-yield bonds should be mentally grouped with those of stocks, not other bonds. Keep in mind that this is a rule of thumb optimizing for simplicity, and other reasonable rules exist. The guideline is deliberately conservative, so a vast majority of future drawdowns will not approach these extremes. As discussed in the [first footnote](https://github.com/investindex/Risk#f1), wars and revolutions have caused the stock markets of individual countries to collapse. For US investors this concern is not especially salient in the domestic market, but it speaks to the merits of geographic diversification.

## Two broad types of risk

It is probably not surprising to read that there are smart and dumb ways to take investment risks. Some people seem to find it entertaining to embrace catastrophic risk and and suffer [crippling financial losses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UY0uS6Z6oE&ab_channel=Benjamin). These smart and dumb types of risk are referred to as _compensated_ and _uncompensated_ risk, respectively. For example, it is riskier to own shares of a globally diversified [fund](https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/VT) of stocks than a globally diversified [fund](https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/BNDW) of bonds. Why are many investors willing to hold stocks despite their greater risk? Because stockholders are _compensated_ for this elevated risk with higher expected return than bondholders. Accepting risk that increases expected return means you are taking a compensated risk. A primary way in which many people assume uncompensated risk is by picking stocks on their own and holding small numbers of stocks. This exposes them to idiosyncratic risks of individual stocks, for which they are not compensated. The general solution to uncompensated risk is diversification. If you want more uncompensated risk, you can try short selling [volatile biotech stocks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80BXR4zX2EE&ab_channel=Benjamin), getting [too much leverage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMO42qkPiio&ab_channel=Benjamin) with total return swaps, or buying short-term, out-of-the-money options. If you don't know what these mean, that's for the best. It should be the goal of an investor to create a portfolio with the appropriate level of risk, and to assume only compensated risks.

&nbsp;

## Are you a stock or a bond?

That's the title of a well-known [book](https://libgen.is/search.php?req=Milevsky+Are+you+a+stock+or+a+bond%3F&lg_topic=libgen&open=0&view=simple&res=25&phrase=1&column=def) by Moshe Milevsky. The question refers to the risk of your human capital, also known as labor capital. Your ability to earn income is an enormous asset, and the stability of the cash flow produced by this asset is an important part of the risk you can accept in financial markets. The classic example of a bond-like person is a tenured university professor, who likely has high job security and uniform income across time. A person with stock-like human capital, in contrast, might be a commissioned salesperson in a volatile industry. Even if the professor and salesperson have the same average income and the same expenses, the professor can afford to embrace more risk in her portfolio, because her human capital generates a stable, bond-like cash flow. The salesperson would need to have a higher risk tolerance to hold the same ratio of stocks to bonds in his brokerage account. And if income or job security in someone's line of work is positively correlated to the fortunes of the stock market, they should be [especially eager](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2018/08/23/are-you-a-stock-or-a-bond) to hold more bonds.

&nbsp;

## Rebalancing — risk maintenance

The primary influence on the risk of a portfolio is its allocation of stocks and bonds. An 80/20 portfolio — with 80% stocks and 20% bonds — is far riskier than a 20/80 portfolio, with 20% stocks and 80% bonds. Secondarily, the risk-return characteristics are affected by allocation to different stock and bond funds within the two broad categories. As discussed above, bond funds vary in risk based on a combination of credit risk and interest rate risk.

Over time, some portions of a portfolio will depart from their initial allocation. During a [bull market](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bullmarket.asp), in which stock returns are generally positive, stock funds tend to become overweighted. During a [bear market](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bearmarket.asp), in which stock returns are persistently negative, bond funds tend to become overweighted. When weights of different funds drift from their initial weights, the portfolio's risk-return profile changes. The solution to this drift is [rebalancing](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rebalancing.asp), which conserves the portfolio's intended risk level.

The most straightforward method of rebalancing is to sell shares in overweighted funds and use the cash to buy shares in underweighted funds. For example, an 80/20 allocation might drift to 83/17 during a long bull market. To restore the intended risk-return characteristics, we would sell shares of stock funds and buy shares of bond funds. The mechanics of rebalancing are covered in the [section on practical information](https://github.com/investindex/Practical#dividends-and-rebalancing).

&nbsp;

## Summary

Investment risk has two components: loss due to risk you took, and missed opportunities due to risk you didn’t take. Careful planning helps you balance them. In particular, the stock market provides stunning returns in the long term, but presents the risk of significant loss in the short term. Risk of short-term loss can be dialed down by investing in bonds with differing characteristics, the lowest risk being in short-term US treasury bonds. Not only do bonds have less volatility overall, but bonds with high credit quality can (but do not always) offset losses when stocks plummet. In contrast, high-yield bonds tend to fall with stocks. Risk that increases expected return is called compensated risk. Rebalancing is how you conserve the risk and expected return of your portfolio.

Footnotes:

<sup id="f1"> 1 </sup> What are realistic expectations for stock market returns? First we should understand _inflation_. It will become evident in the section on [retirement planning](https://github.com/investindex/Retirement) that returns after accounting for inflation are what matter to long-term investors. Your return before inflation is called the _nominal return_, and your return after inflation is called the _real return_. Imagine a 10% average annual return over some number of years, accompanied by average annual inflation of 3.5%. To correctly calculate the real return, we need to convert these percentage changes to multipliers. The nominal return of 10% as a multiplier is 1.1, and 3.5% inflation as a multiplier is 1.035, so the real return as a multiplier is 1.1/1.035 = 1.0628, which is a 6.28% real return. There are other paths to the same real return: 7.34% nominal return and 1% inflation provides a real return of 1.0734/1.01 = 1.0628, again 6.28%.

What are average stock market returns in real terms (i.e., after inflation)? I will use data from the summary of the [Credit Suisse Global Investment Returns Yearbook 2021](https://www.credit-suisse.com/media/assets/corporate/docs/about-us/research/publications/credit-suisse-global-investment-returns-yearbook-2021-summary-edition.pdf), which contains data from 1900 through 2020. Globally, the average annual real return was 5.3% (in US dollar terms; Figure 38). After excluding hyperinflation events in Germany and Austria in the early 1920s, average annual inflation was 2.6% (Figure 5). This implies an average nominal return of about 8.0%. The average real return in the US was 6.6%, with an average nominal return of nearly 10%.

The superior results of the US market were partially caused by the lack of widespread physical or political devastation since 1900. Japanese stocks lost 97% of value and bonds lost 99% of value due to World War II (in US dollar terms; pp. 38, 40). The stock markets of Russia and China closed down in 1917 and 1949, respectively, due to their communist revolutions. Stock- and bondholders experienced virtually total loss and markets did not reopen for decades. The global average of 5.3% real annual returns includes catastrophic losses like these.

Although the US had exceptional performance in the past, exceeded by only Australia and South Africa, this does not imply that we can expect the US to outperform the rest of the world over the next several decades. To paraphrase Cliff Asness, [the long run can lie to you](https://www.aqr.com/Insights/Perspectives/The-Long-Run-Is-Lying-to-You). He showed in the linked article that US outperformance of international stocks from 1980 to 2020 was due almost entirely to higher growth in valuations rather than higher growth in fundamentals. That is, US companies did not experience significantly greater growth per share in fundamentals like earnings, but US stocks became more expensive than international stocks. There are some long-run trends we have good reason to think will persist, like stocks outperforming bonds, but this is not one of them. Simply observing that something has occurred over a long period of time is not a valid justification for assuming that it will continue to occur. [↩](#fn1)

<sup id="f2"> 2 </sup> For funds with minimal risk that _still_ usually have higher returns than money market funds, see ultrashort-term bond funds which hold bonds with an average remaining maturity of one year or less, such as [VUSB](https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/overview/VUSB), [SHV](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239466/ishares-short-treasury-bond-etf), [ULST](https://www.ssga.com/us/en/individual/etfs/funds/spdr-ssga-ultra-short-term-bond-etf-ulst), [BILS](https://www.ssga.com/us/en/individual/etfs/funds/spdr-bloomberg-barclays-3-12-month-t-bill-etf-bils), and [CLTL](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=CLTL). [SGOV](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/314116/ishares-0-3-month-treasury-bond-etf) and [BIL](https://www.ssga.com/us/en/individual/etfs/funds/spdr-bloomberg-barclays-1-3-month-t-bill-etf-bil) approximate the risk-free rate of return by investing in US treasury bonds with remaining maturities of three months or less. [↩](#fn2)

&nbsp;

<sup id="f3"> 3 </sup> Another level deeper in understanding bonds involves the term [_convexity_](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/convexity.asp). [Duration](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/duration.asp) expresses the rate at which a bond's market value changes in response to a given change in interest rates. It measures interest rate sensitivity. Convexity expresses the rate at which a bond's duration changes in response to a given change in interest rates. For those familiar with calculus, duration is the first derivative of market value with respect to interest rate, and convexity is the second derivative. A good explanation of these concepts is in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2h361u2byo&t=3252s&ab_channel=PatrickBoyle). Bond portfolios with the same average duration can have different expected responses to changes in the [yield curve](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/y/yieldcurve.asp), and this is expressed by convexity. To put it more concretely, the properties of a portfolio split between short-term and long-term bonds are different than those of a portfolio of intermediate-term bonds with the same average duration. The former is called a barbell portfolio (heavy on short and long), while the latter is called a bullet portfolio. [↩](#fn3)

<sup id="f4"> 4 </sup> Further detail on S&P 500 total return. 1989-90 drawdown: peak Oct 10 1989, nadir Nov 6 1989 with drawdown of 7.3%, recovery by Jan 2 1990. 2020 crash: peak Feb 19 2020, nadir Mar 23 2020 with drawdown of 33.8%, recovery by Aug 10 2020. Global Financial Crisis: peak Oct 9 2007, nadir Mar 9 2009 with drawdown of 55.3%, recovery by Apr 2 2012. (This was short-lived: it fell again after that day and took until Aug 16 2012 to exceed the 2007 peak again, after which it rose steadily.) 1970s crash: peak Jan 1973, nadir Oct 1974 with drawdown of roughly 48%, recovery by May 1978. 2000-2002 bear market: peak Sep 1 2000, nadir Oct 9 2002 with drawdown of 47.4%, recovery by Oct 23 2006. (There was also a peak on Mar 24 2000 with a value of 99.93% that of the peak on Sep 1. This extends the period of unrealized loss from six years and two months to six years and seven months.)

The 2000s were disappointing because the combination of two severe bear markets led to extended periods of zero return. How far can we go back and still find a higher value than the bottom of the Great Recession on Mar 9 2009? May 5 1997 — nearly 12 years. And how far forward do we need to move before we permanently exceed the peak reached on Mar 24 2000? This finally happens on Dec 21 2010, well over ten years later. Note that this does not mean 12 years of investing would have turned out useless: there is no way to reliably time the market and sell at a peak like Mar 24 2000, or buy at the bottom of a trough like Mar 9 2009.

Calculations for the 1989-90 drawdown, 2020 crash, Great Recession, and 2000-2002 bear market relied on values of the [S&P 500 total return](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5ESP500TR) from Yahoo! Finance. Using the [S&P 500 price](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EGSPC) ignores dividends. This leads to exaggeration of bear markets, especially when calculating the time between nadir and recovery to previous peak. Calculations for the 1970s drawdown relied on [this calculator](https://dqydj.com/sp-500-return-calculator), which uses Robert Shiller's [data](http://www.econ.yale.edu/~shiller/data.htm). The drawdown estimate of 48% relied on the S&P 500 price on Oct 3 1974, because distortions due to omitting dividends are mild on the downward half. [↩](#fn4)

&nbsp;

<sup id="f5"> 5 </sup> How bad was the Great Depression? A seemingly widespread misconception among those who read about investing is that the US stock market took 25 years to recover from the crash that started in 1929. It's true that the prices of the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the predecessor to the S&P 500 didn't recover to their 1929 peaks until 1954. But as stated in the footnote above, this is a misleading and often very incorrect way of computing the duration of a drawdown. Price charts do not include dividends, which means they always understate performance in terms of total return. On top of this, the Great Depression was a highly deflationary period. Most bear markets are extended if you account for inflation, but the Great Depression is exaggerated by neglecting deflation. After factoring in dividends and deflation, we can use [this calculator](https://dqydj.com/sp-500-return-calculator) based on Robert Shiller's [data](http://www.econ.yale.edu/~shiller/data.htm) to see that the drawdown beginning in Sep 1929 lasted only about seven years (until Nov 1936). Nominally — that is, without accounting for deflation — the drawdown lasted about 15 years (until Jan 1945, roughly). The nadir of the drawdown was in June 1932 at a loss of slightly over 80%.
