# Thinking about risk

“How much of my money should I invest?” is a question that cannot be avoided — to invest none of it is a tacit decision. And how should it be invested? Any good answer would be highly personalized, but the right information about risk can help anyone think about these questions.

In the context of investment, one can consider risk of loss on a spectrum: some securities can safely be considered to carry no risk, like [certificates of deposit](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/certificateofdeposit.asp) and [US treasury bills](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/treasurybill.asp); some have moderate risk, such as diversified index funds; and others carry high risk, such as [hedge fund purchases of distressed debt](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/bonds/08/distressed-debt-hedge-fund.asp). The lowest-risk options generate small returns and, in the current low-interest environment, will not even keep pace with inflation. Stock market index funds require the investor to accept meaningful risk, with the potential for much greater reward.

What do lifetime returns from index funds look like? According to [this article](https://www.wsj.com/articles/lessons-from-a-crazy-year-in-financial-markets-11609410602), placing $10,000 in an S&P 500 index fund in Jan 1980 with dividend reinvestments would have yielded nearly $700,000 of growth by August 2020. This is an impressive reward for leaving money alone, especially in contrast to any low-risk alternative. The average annual appreciation was just over 11%. Now imagine a different scenario, in which you added savings to a tax-advantaged retirement account at the beginning of every year. You started with $1,000 in 1980 and increased by $100 each year through 2020. For simplicity, imagine that your investment grew at the average rate the whole time. By the end of August 2020 you contributed $123,000 but your account reached a value of about $1.3 million. These examples are simplistic but exhibit the power of compounding growth.

Keep in mind that between 1980 and 2020, the returns during many individual months and even several calendar years were negative. Most years yielded returns that [deviated significantly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhYHrHiOS_E&ab_channel=BenFelixBenFelixVerified) from the average: seemingly extreme returns, like +20% or -8%, should be part of expectations. We can’t be sure if future returns will be as high as those in the past. But the historical record illustrates that diversified index funds carry risk of loss only in the short term; in the long term, they will grow as long as society continues to function normally.

The question which follows for most people is what portion of their wealth is safe to invest in stocks and other assets, given that they may need to draw on investments due to emergencies, insufficient income for normal expenses, or large purchases such as a car or house. The great fear is that, when in need of money, they will turn to the investments meant to expand their wealth and find that instead they have lost value, perhaps drastically. Some forms of this fear are valid and the risks of any investment should be researched before action is taken. If you will _need_ the money you’re considering investing a year from now, and you will need _all_ of it, then stock funds are unsuitable, and any securities with higher risk (such as individual stocks) are unsuitable.

## Bonds and the spectrum of risk

How can you invest money that can’t be exposed to the volatility of the stock market? A primary way of doing this is through [bonds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bond.asp). Banks make money by providing people with loans in exchange for interest payments and the eventual repayment of the principal. Like banks, you can invest in debt through bonds, also known as fixed income. Bonds have less risk and less long-term return than stocks, partly because bondholders have higher priority than common stockholders if a company declares bankruptcy. Bonds with longer maturity — those with timelines up to 30 years until the debt is fully paid — have higher risk and return than those with shorter maturity. Bonds which are [less likely](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditquality.asp) to be paid back in full command higher returns to accompany their risk. Without needing to deeply understand how individual bonds are priced and sold, anyone can easily invest in government and corporate bonds through an ETF or mutual fund.
