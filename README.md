# Thinking about risk

“How much of my money should I invest?” is a question that cannot be avoided — to invest none of it is a tacit decision. And how should it be invested? Any good answer would be highly personalized, but the right information about risk can help anyone think about these questions.

In the context of investment, one can consider risk of loss on a spectrum: some securities can safely be considered to carry no risk, like [certificates of deposit](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/certificateofdeposit.asp) and [US treasury bills](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/treasurybill.asp); some have moderate risk, such as diversified index funds; and others carry high risk, such as [hedge fund purchases of distressed debt](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/bonds/08/distressed-debt-hedge-fund.asp). The lowest-risk options generate small returns and, in the current low-interest environment, will not even keep pace with inflation. Stock market index funds require the investor to accept meaningful risk, with the potential for much greater reward.

What do lifetime returns from index funds look like? According to [this article](https://www.wsj.com/articles/lessons-from-a-crazy-year-in-financial-markets-11609410602), placing $10,000 in an S&P 500 index fund in Jan 1980 with dividend reinvestments would have yielded nearly $700,000 of growth by August 2020. This is an impressive reward for leaving money alone, especially in contrast to any low-risk alternative. The average annual appreciation was just over 11%. Now imagine a different scenario, in which you added savings to a tax-advantaged retirement account at the beginning of every year. You started with $1,000 in 1980 and increased by $100 each year through 2020. For simplicity, imagine that your investment grew at the average rate the whole time. By the end of August 2020 you contributed $123,000 but your account reached a value of about $1.3 million. These examples are simplistic but exhibit the power of compounding growth.

Keep in mind that between 1980 and 2020, the returns during many individual months and even several calendar years were negative. Most years yielded returns that [deviated significantly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhYHrHiOS_E&ab_channel=BenFelixBenFelixVerified) from the average: seemingly extreme returns, like +20% or -8%, should be part of expectations. We can’t be sure if future returns will be as high as those in the past. But the historical record illustrates that diversified index funds carry risk of loss only in the short term; in the long term, they will grow as long as society continues to function normally.

The question which follows for most people is what portion of their wealth is safe to invest in stocks and other assets, given that they may need to draw on investments due to emergencies, insufficient income for normal expenses, or large purchases such as a car or house. The great fear is that, when in need of money, they will turn to the investments meant to expand their wealth and find that instead they have lost value, perhaps drastically. Some forms of this fear are valid and the risks of any investment should be researched before action is taken. If you will _need_ the money you’re considering investing a year from now, and you will need _all_ of it, then stock funds are unsuitable, and any securities with higher risk (such as individual stocks) are unsuitable.

## Bonds and the spectrum of risk

How can you invest money that can’t be exposed to the volatility of the stock market? A primary way of doing this is through [bonds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bond.asp). Banks make money by providing people with loans in exchange for interest payments and the eventual repayment of the principal. Like banks, you can invest in debt through bonds, also known as fixed income. Bonds have less risk and less long-term return than stocks, partly because bondholders have higher priority than common stockholders if a company declares bankruptcy. Bonds with longer maturity — those with timelines up to 30 years until the debt is fully paid — have higher risk and return than those with shorter maturity. Bonds which are [less likely](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditquality.asp) to be paid back in full command higher returns to accompany their risk. Without needing to deeply understand how individual bonds are priced and sold, anyone can easily invest in government and corporate bonds through an ETF or mutual fund.

We can think about the role of bonds by walking through layers of risk and return. First is your checking account, which holds money you anticipate using in the immediate future. A checking account has zero risk and zero return. What could you do to generate modest returns for the money you don’t need at your fingertips, without exposing it to substantial risk? The most straightforward candidate is a fund with high-quality, short-term bonds. This is a place for slow, safe growth. It can hold money you anticipate needing in the next one to two years. Close to rock bottom for the slowest, safest growth is a short-term US treasury bond fund ([VGSH](https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/VGSH) / [SHY](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239452/ishares-13-year-treasury-bond-etf) / [SPTS](https://www.ssga.com/us/en/individual/etfs/funds/spdr-portfolio-short-term-treasury-etf-spts) / [SCHO](https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/products/scho)). If you are willing to accept minor, occasional declines in value, you will find greater overall appreciation in a short-term bond fund ([BSV](https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/overview/BSV) / [SWSBX](https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/products/swsbx)) or a short-term corporate bond fund ([VCSH](https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/VCSH) / [IGSB](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239451/ishares-13-year-credit-bond-etf) / [SPSB](https://www.ssga.com/us/en/individual/etfs/funds/spdr-portfolio-short-term-corporate-bond-etf-spsb) / [SCHJ](https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/products/schj)). A broader bond fund like BSV contains both government and corporate bonds, so funds like VCSH that hold purely corporate bonds generate greater long-term growth and harbor more potential for small declines in value. Returns from short-term bond funds may seem trivial, but they become impressive in the long run and are far better than returns from a savings account, [money market fund](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/money-marketfund.asp), or certificate of deposit. Any portion can be promptly withdrawn when you need it.

Behind your short-term bonds should be intermediate- and long-term bonds. Here you could hold part of the money reserved for periods beyond the nearest future but in the upcoming five years. Long-term bonds are riskier than short-term bonds but far safer than stocks. Their average growth is much stronger than that of short-term bond funds. You could use a long-term bond fund ([BLV](https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/BLV) / [ILTB](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239424/ishares-core-longterm-us-bond-etf)) or a long-term corporate bond fund ([VCLT](https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/VCLT) / [IGLB](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239423/ishares-10-year-credit-bond-etf) / [SPLB](https://www.ssga.com/us/en/individual/etfs/funds/spdr-portfolio-long-term-corporate-bond-etf-splb)). As before, the corporate bond funds entail somewhat more return as well as higher risk of moderate dips in value. If you decide there is a role in your finances for the temperate qualities of intermediate-term bonds, there are several offerings for corporate bond funds ([VCIT](https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/overview/VCIT) / [IGIB](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239463/ishares-intermediate-credit-bond-etf) / [SPIB](https://www.ssga.com/us/en/individual/etfs/funds/spdr-portfolio-intermediate-term-corporate-bond-etf-spib) / [SCHI](https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/products/schi)) and broader funds which hold both government and corporate bonds ([BIV](https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/overview/BIV) / [IMTB](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/285539/ishares-core-5-10-year-usd-bond-etf)).

In contrast to the minor volatility of short-term bond funds, there are some years in which long-term bond funds undergo significant dips in total return (i.e., a single-digit percentage). They are more vulnerable to the [risk of interest rates rising](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestraterisk.asp) as well as the risk that a change in economic circumstances will increase [defaults on corporate debt](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/defaultrisk.asp). A decline in interest rates would be a boon to long-term bonds, but interest rates are already at historically low levels. Although not a strict prerequisite for investing in bonds, understanding the concept of bond [duration](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/duration.asp) will improve your appreciation for how interest rates affect bond valuation.

If you’d prefer only one bond ETF, you could buy shares of a total US bond fund ([BND](https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/BND) / [AGG](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239458/ishares-core-total-us-bond-market-etf) / [SPAB](https://www.ssga.com/us/en/individual/etfs/funds/spdr-portfolio-aggregate-bond-etf-spab) / [SCHZ](https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/products/schz)), a total US corporate bond fund ([VTC](https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/overview/VTC) / [LQD](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239566/ishares-iboxx-investment-grade-corporate-bond-etf) / [SPBO](https://www.ssga.com/us/en/individual/etfs/funds/spdr-portfolio-corporate-bond-etf-spbo)), or a total global bond fund ([BNDW](https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/overview/BNDW)). But your allocation of different bond maturities, and the overall risk-return profile, may not be ideal. Regardless of your choices, ensure that each fund’s expense ratio is very low. The comparatively low returns of bonds make this especially important for fund selection.

Bond funds typically pay monthly dividends. The best default for most people is to automatically reinvest these dividends in more shares of the fund. When you need to withdraw money from the fund, you can either turn off automatic reinvestment and wait for the next dividend payment, or you can simply sell shares of the fund. See the section on taxes for the different tax implications these actions carry.

Finally, behind your long-term bond funds should be the stock index funds introduced at the beginning. They will generate the bulk of your investment returns. The various funds that could form your stock portfolio will be discussed in later sections. First, we should address how to think through allocation of your reserves to stocks and long-term bonds.
