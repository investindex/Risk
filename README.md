# Thinking about risk

“How much of my money should I invest?” is a question that cannot be avoided — to invest none of it is a tacit decision. And how should it be invested? Any good answer would be highly personalized, but the right information about risk can help anyone think about these questions.

In the context of investment, one can consider risk of loss on a spectrum: some securities can safely be considered to carry no risk, like [certificates of deposit](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/certificateofdeposit.asp) and [US treasury bills](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/treasurybill.asp); some have moderate risk, such as diversified index funds; and others carry high risk, such as [hedge fund purchases of distressed debt](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/bonds/08/distressed-debt-hedge-fund.asp). The lowest-risk options generate small returns and, in the current low-interest environment, will not even keep pace with inflation. Stock market index funds require the investor to accept meaningful risk, with the potential for much greater reward.

What do lifetime returns from index funds look like? According to [this article](https://www.wsj.com/articles/lessons-from-a-crazy-year-in-financial-markets-11609410602), placing $10,000 in an S&P 500 index fund in Jan 1980 with dividend reinvestments would have yielded nearly $700,000 of growth by August 2020. This is an impressive reward for leaving money alone, especially in contrast to any low-risk alternative. The average annual appreciation was just over 11%. Now imagine a different scenario, in which you added savings to a [tax-advantaged retirement account](https://github.com/investindex/Guidelines#tax-advantaged-accounts) at the beginning of every year. You started with $1,000 in 1980 and increased by $100 each year through 2020. For simplicity, imagine that your investment grew at the average rate the whole time. By the end of August 2020 you contributed $123,000 but your account reached a value of about $1.3 million. These examples are simplistic but exhibit the power of compounding growth.

</p>

Keep in mind that between 1980 and 2020, the returns during many individual months and even several calendar years were negative. Most years yielded returns that [deviated significantly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhYHrHiOS_E&ab_channel=BenFelixBenFelixVerified) from the average: seemingly extreme returns, like +20% or -8%, should be part of expectations. We can’t be sure if future returns will be as high as those in the past — don't count on 11%. But the historical record illustrates that diversified index funds carry risk of loss only in the short term; in the long term, they will grow as long as society continues to function normally.

The question which follows for most people is what portion of their wealth is safe to invest in stocks and other assets, given that they may need to draw on investments due to emergencies, insufficient income for normal expenses, or large purchases such as a car or house. The great fear is that, when in need of money, they will turn to the investments meant to expand their wealth and find that instead they have lost value, perhaps drastically. Some forms of this fear are valid and the risks of any investment should be researched before action is taken. If you will _need_ the money you’re considering investing a year from now, and you will need _all_ of it, then stock funds are unsuitable, and any securities with higher risk (such as individual stocks) are unsuitable.

&nbsp;

## Bonds and the spectrum of risk

How can you invest money that can’t be exposed to the volatility of the stock market? A primary way of doing this is through [bonds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bond.asp). Banks make money by providing people with loans in exchange for interest payments and the eventual repayment of the principal. Like banks, you can invest in debt through bonds, also known as fixed income. Bonds have less risk and less long-term return than stocks, partly because bondholders have higher priority than common stockholders if a company declares bankruptcy. Bonds with longer maturity — those with timelines up to 30 years until the debt is fully paid — have higher risk and return than those with shorter maturity. Bonds which are [less likely](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditquality.asp) to be paid back in full command higher returns to accompany their risk. Without needing to deeply understand how individual bonds are priced and sold, anyone can easily invest in government and corporate bonds through an ETF or mutual fund.

We can think about the role of bonds by walking through layers of risk and return. First is your checking account, which holds money you anticipate using in the immediate future. A checking account has zero risk and zero return. What could you do to generate modest returns for the money you don’t need at your fingertips, without exposing it to substantial risk? The most straightforward candidate is a fund with high-quality, short-term bonds. This is a place for slow, safe growth. It can hold money you anticipate needing in the next one to two years. Close to rock bottom for the slowest, safest growth is a short-term US treasury bond fund ([VGSH](https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/VGSH) / [SHY](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239452/ishares-13-year-treasury-bond-etf) / [SPTS](https://www.ssga.com/us/en/individual/etfs/funds/spdr-portfolio-short-term-treasury-etf-spts) / [SCHO](https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/products/scho)). If you are willing to accept minor, occasional declines in value, you will find greater overall appreciation in a short-term bond fund ([BSV](https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/overview/BSV) / [SWSBX](https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/products/swsbx)) or a short-term corporate bond fund ([VCSH](https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/VCSH) / [IGSB](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239451/ishares-13-year-credit-bond-etf) / [SPSB](https://www.ssga.com/us/en/individual/etfs/funds/spdr-portfolio-short-term-corporate-bond-etf-spsb) / [SCHJ](https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/products/schj)). A broader bond fund like BSV contains both government and corporate bonds, so funds like VCSH that hold purely corporate bonds generate greater long-term growth and harbor more potential for small declines in value. Returns from short-term bond funds may seem trivial, but they become impressive in the long run and are far better than returns from a savings account, certificate of deposit, or [money market fund](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/money-marketfund.asp).<sup id="fn1">[1](#f1)</sup> Any portion can be promptly withdrawn when you need it.

Behind your short-term bonds should be intermediate- and long-term bonds. Here you could hold part of the money reserved for periods beyond the nearest future but in the upcoming five years. Long-term bonds are riskier than short-term bonds but far safer than stocks. Their average growth is much stronger than that of short-term bond funds. You could use a long-term bond fund ([BLV](https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/BLV) / [ILTB](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239424/ishares-core-longterm-us-bond-etf)) or a long-term corporate bond fund ([VCLT](https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/VCLT) / [IGLB](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239423/ishares-10-year-credit-bond-etf) / [SPLB](https://www.ssga.com/us/en/individual/etfs/funds/spdr-portfolio-long-term-corporate-bond-etf-splb)). As before, the corporate bond funds entail somewhat more return as well as higher risk of moderate dips in value. If you decide there is a role in your portfolio for the temperate qualities of intermediate-term bonds, there are several offerings for corporate bond funds ([VCIT](https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/overview/VCIT) / [IGIB](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239463/ishares-intermediate-credit-bond-etf) / [SPIB](https://www.ssga.com/us/en/individual/etfs/funds/spdr-portfolio-intermediate-term-corporate-bond-etf-spib) / [SCHI](https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/products/schi)) and broader funds which hold both government and corporate bonds ([BIV](https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/overview/BIV) / [IMTB](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/285539/ishares-core-5-10-year-usd-bond-etf)).

In contrast to the minor volatility of short-term bond funds, there are some years in which long-term bond funds undergo significant dips in total return (i.e., a single-digit percentage). They are more vulnerable to the [risk of interest rates rising](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestraterisk.asp) as well as the risk that a change in economic circumstances will increase [defaults on corporate debt](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/defaultrisk.asp). Rising interest rates cause existing bonds to fall in value because terms of payment for the bondholders become less attractive than those of new bonds with higher interest payments. A decline in interest rates would be a boon to long-term bonds, but interest rates are already at historically low levels. Changes in interest rates do not affect the income from existing bonds; they affect the market value of existing bonds and therefore the share prices of bond funds. Although not a strict prerequisite for investing in bonds, understanding the concept of bond [duration](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/duration.asp) will improve your appreciation for how interest rates affect bond valuation.<sup id="fn2">[2](#f2)</sup>

If you’d prefer only one bond fund, you could buy shares of a fund with bonds of maturities balanced between short, intermediate, and long. These aggregate bond market funds include a total US bond fund ([BND](https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/BND) / [AGG](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239458/ishares-core-total-us-bond-market-etf) / [SPAB](https://www.ssga.com/us/en/individual/etfs/funds/spdr-portfolio-aggregate-bond-etf-spab) / [SCHZ](https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/products/schz)), a total US corporate bond fund ([VTC](https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/overview/VTC) / [LQD](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239566/ishares-iboxx-investment-grade-corporate-bond-etf) / [SPBO](https://www.ssga.com/us/en/individual/etfs/funds/spdr-portfolio-corporate-bond-etf-spbo)), or a total global bond fund ([BNDW](https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/overview/BNDW)). But your allocation of different bond maturities, and the overall risk-return profile, may not be ideal. The interest rate risk levels of these aggregate funds are about the same or somewhat higher than those of intermediate-term funds. Regardless of your selections, ensure that each fund’s expense ratio is very low. The comparatively low returns of bonds make this especially important. See the [fund proposal section](https://github.com/investindex/Funds#summary) for a summary table of all the bond funds.

Bond funds typically pay monthly dividends. The best default for most people is to automatically reinvest these dividends in more shares of the fund. When you need to withdraw money from the fund, you could turn off automatic reinvestment and wait for the next dividend payment. However, selling shares of the fund is more likely to be suitable both in terms of timing and the dollar amount you need. See the [section on taxes](https://github.com/investindex/Taxes) for the different tax implications these actions carry. I mentioned previously that stock ETFs are more tax-efficient than stock mutual funds, but the same distinction does not apply to bond funds, because unlike stock ETFs, bond ETFs sometimes need to [distribute capital gains](https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/investment-products/etf/etfs-tax-efficiency). So for instance, someone investing in bonds in a taxable Schwab brokerage account has no tax-related reason to prefer [SCHZ](https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/products/schz) to [SWAGX](https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/products/swagx). As long as buying shares of SWAGX does not entail a fee — which it does not because this person is using a Schwab account — they may prefer the mutual fund SWAGX because it allows them to invest a precise dollar amount.

Finally, behind your long-term bond funds should be the stock index funds introduced at the beginning. They will generate the bulk of your investment returns. The various funds that could form your stock portfolio will be discussed in later sections. First, we should address how to think through allocation of your reserves to stocks and long-term bonds.

&nbsp;

## Allocation and overall risk

One way of assessing how you should distribute your risk is considering what your worst-case scenario would be given a possible distribution. First consider what could go wrong in your life anytime: a totaled car, a health crisis, an unexpected home repair, loss of your income or the income of anyone who might depend on you. Then consider that something like this might happen around the same time that your investments drop significantly in value. This would be unlucky, but your financial planning should account for it.

Another risk to consider is the possibility of not meeting your basic needs and personal goals in the long run. You could keep everything in short-term bonds for decades and never suffer a major loss, but the missed opportunities would be vast. Your approach should not be so conservative that it fails to provide you with enough money throughout your working life or during retirement.

Note the tension between these considerations. Envisioning your long-term goals will push you toward more risk and return, whereas recalling the possibility of loss in the short term will remind you to approach risk carefully.

### Preparing for loss

How risky are stocks and bonds? The risk presented by individual stocks and by a diversified stock portfolio are fundamentally different. A single stock can lose nearly all of its value and never recover. A diversified index fund or group of funds tracking the US or global stock market will eventually rebound from downturns. The crucial difference is that a diversified investor need not worry about unrecoverable losses if they have the financial and psychological means to simply wait. So the primary concern is better thought of as volatility rather than loss, because however terrifying it may be, unrealized loss is temporary for a diversified stockholder.

Periods of major unrealized loss are sometimes brief. After the market crashed in February and March 2020, it took only six months from the beginning of the [drawdown](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/drawdown.asp) for the S&P 500 to exceed its previous peak. Less commonly, this process can also take several years. The decline beginning in October 2007 lasted until March 2009, and persistent recovery above the previous peak did not arrive until August 2012, nearly five years after the drawdown began. The Great Recession was not the only deep, extended period of loss in modern history: a [bear market](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bearmarket.asp) starting in January 1973 did not see its bottom until October 1974 or a persistent recovery until December 1978, for a total of six years.<sup id="fn3">[3](#f3)</sup> Keep in mind that the drawdowns beginning in 1973 and 2007 were unusually severe; only the Great Depression was deeper. The take-home message is that periods of major unrealized loss vary greatly, and this uncertainty is part of the psychological struggle. Participation in the stock market means being prepared for a multiyear period in which returns are zero.

There are two positive notes to counterbalance this bleak reminder. First, as disastrous as these bear markets might seem in the midst of them, the period we reviewed from 1980 to 2020 included numerous bear markets and still emerged with fantastic overall returns. Second, [risk factor diversification](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKWbW7Wgm0w&ab_channel=BenFelix) can significantly reduce the duration of these drawdowns, compared to a portfolio of only the S&P 500 or only the total market. Small cap value stocks recovered from the 1970s bear market a couple years earlier than the S&P 500, and their overall performance for the decade [crushed](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-asset-class-allocation) the performance of large cap stocks (like the S&P 500). The 1970s would have been a decade of strong growth for someone who highly overweighted small cap value stocks. We will expand on risk factor diversification in the [section on stock portfolios](https://github.com/investindex/Portfolio).

Disasters for long-term bonds are comparatively mild. The market values of bonds, especially those of long-term bonds, are sensitive to changes in interest rates. Take Vanguard's long-term bond ETF ([BLV](https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/performance/blv/cumulative-returns)) as an example. Its average annual five-year total return at the end of 2012 was 10.0%. After this successful period, interest rates increased and in 2013, BLV's total return was -8.9%. The fund rebounded in 2014 with a 20.1% total return. 2013 was the worst year of the 21st century for US long-term bonds. For someone holding long-term bonds split evenly between corporate and US treasury bonds, the [worst period](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-asset-class-allocation) in modern history was July 1979 to February 1980 with a loss of 17.6%. Recovery occurred later that year by June 1980.

Based on the historical data, I will suggest the following disaster scenarios for financial planning: a 20% [drawdown](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/drawdown.asp) of long-term bonds or an 80% drawdown of the stock market. Such events are expected to be extremely rare, and they are not characteristic of an overwhelming majority of declines in value for stock or long-term bond indices. In particular, many people argue that the US stock market is far more transparent and better-regulated than during the Great Depression era, and that an enduring collapse like that one is inconceivable now.<sup id="fn4">[4](#f4)</sup> I am tempted to agree, but it is hard to agree so completely that I would stake my financial solvency on it.

Could both of these drawdowns happen at the same time? Large declines in the value of stock funds and long-term bond funds are unlikely to co-occur for very long. In the event of a bear market, the Federal Reserve lowers interest rates to encourage borrowing and spending, which boosts long-term bonds. Of course, corporate bonds with high default risk are in particular jeopardy when the stock market plummets, which is why I recommend government and investment-grade corporate bonds, not [high-yield bonds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/high_yield_bond.asp).

So it may be most realistic to work out your financial situation if you needed to draw on your investments at the bottom of an 80% decline in stocks _or_ a 20% decline in long-term bonds. You may also want to consider the even smaller potential drawdowns of other bonds. I will suggest a 5% drawdown for short-term bonds and a 12% drawdown for intermediate-term bonds / aggregate US bond market funds. Keep in mind that this is a rule of thumb optimizing for simplicity, and other reasonable rules exist. The guideline is deliberately conservative, so a vast majority of future drawdowns will not approach these extremes.

### Preparing for the long run

We also need to consider how investments will reward us throughout our life, and especially during retirement. 

Factors over which you exercise some control include:  
-Income during your working years and changes in income over time;  
-Allocation and timing of investments;  
-Use of [tax-advantaged accounts](https://github.com/investindex/Guidelines#tax-advantaged-accounts);  
-At what age you may merge finances with a long-term partner;  
-At what age you may have children;  
-Support you expect to provide to and receive from your family;  
-How much you will spend, save, and invest during working years;  
-How much you will change your spending after retirement;  
-How you will change your investment approach after retirement;  
-Age of retirement;  
-Whether you retire suddenly or continue earning a smaller income for some time;  
-Personal goals such as charitable donations or leaving money for your children.

Factors over which you exercise little or no control include:  
-[Asset class](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/assetclasses.asp) returns for stocks and bonds;  
-Inflation rates;  
-Interest rates;  
-Tax rates;  
-Government benefits like Social Security, which may change by the time you retire.

Although there are variables you cannot control, like federal tax rates, you can adjust variables which are under your control, like savings rates, to make it more likely that you’ll be prepared for an uncertain future. There are also factors which are under your control to a great degree, except in rare situations. Health is a perfect example: most people have the opportunity to reduce expected health care costs by keeping themselves healthy, but it is always possible to be dealt an unavoidable illness or injury. Risks like these are covered in the [next section's guidelines](https://github.com/investindex/Guidelines#minimize-risk-of-catastrophic-loss).

Many of these variables can be entered into an online retirement calculator like [this one](https://www.bankrate.com/retirement/calculators/retirement-plan-calculator/). Basic calculators give you an idea of how your saving and investing will add up in the long run, and whether they can sustain you during retirement. But make sure to consider the factors not explicitly included in these calculators, like unexpected support you may need to provide to children or aging parents in middle age, and potentially [very high](https://newsroom.fidelity.com/press-releases/news-details/2021/Fidelitys-20th-Annual-Retiree-Health-Care-Cost-Estimate-Hits-New-High-A-Couple-Retiring-Today-Will-Need-300000-to-Cover-Medical-Expenses-an-88-Increase-Since-2002/default.aspx) medical costs in old age. These calculations will be rough. The future is uncertain and it’s not possible to include everything that could influence your wealth. But working out imprecise numbers is far better than the vague assumptions that would take their place. Planning your future will also demonstrate how useful it is to keep track of your spending. Exactly how much do you spend on food? How much does car maintenance cost? You will be able to project future spending far more accurately if you record and categorize your current spending. You may also be able to target areas in which you’re spending more than you thought.

Some of the math needed for retirement planning is more advanced than many people are used to. It's important not to rely on opaque calculators and to understand the assumptions behind the numbers that guide your saving and investing. The details of retirement math are explained [in the next section](https://github.com/investindex/Guidelines#retirement-math).

## Market timing and your psychology

This section is incomplete pending an analysis I need to do on market timing.

[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PYsVkPtcXk&ab_channel=BenFelix) on market crashes by Ben Felix was released in the midst of the 2020 COVID-related stock market crash. Its timing within the crisis endows it with the feeling of a coach giving a motivational halftime talk as the team is losing badly. Ben gives exactly the right advice for dealing with losses and provides historical background.

&nbsp;

## Summary

Investment risk has two components: loss due to risk you took, and missed opportunities due to risk you didn’t take. Careful planning helps you balance them. In particular, the stock market provides stunning returns in the long term, but presents the risk of significant loss in the short term. Risk of short-term loss can be dialed down by investing in bonds with differing characteristics, the lowest risk being in short-term US treasury bonds. Retirement planning is complex and imperfect, but planning throughout your life will provide a reality check for your saving and investing habits.

Footnotes:

<sup id="f1"> 1 </sup> For funds with minimal risk that _still_ usually have higher returns than money market funds, see ultrashort-term bond funds which hold bonds with an average remaining maturity of one year or less, such as [VUSB](https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/overview/VUSB), [SHV](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239466/ishares-short-treasury-bond-etf), [BILS](https://www.ssga.com/us/en/individual/etfs/funds/spdr-bloomberg-barclays-3-12-month-t-bill-etf-bils), and [CLTL](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=CLTL). [SGOV](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/314116/ishares-0-3-month-treasury-bond-etf) and [BIL](https://www.ssga.com/us/en/individual/etfs/funds/spdr-bloomberg-barclays-1-3-month-t-bill-etf-bil) approximate the risk-free rate of return by investing in US treasury bonds with remaining maturities of three months or less. [↩](#fn1)

<sup id="f2"> 2 </sup> Another level deeper in understanding bonds involves the term [_convexity_](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/convexity.asp). It expresses how bond portfolios with the same average [duration](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/duration.asp) have different expected responses to changes in the [yield curve](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/y/yieldcurve.asp). To put it more simply, the properties of a portfolio split between short-term and long-term bonds are different than those of a portfolio of intermediate-term bonds with the same average duration. The former is called a barbell portfolio (heavy on short and long), while the latter is called a bullet portfolio. [↩](#fn2)

<sup id="f3"> 3 </sup> Further detail on S&P 500 total return. 2020 crash: peak Feb 19 2020, nadir Mar 23 2020 with drawdown of 33.8%, recovery by Aug 10 2020. Great Recession: peak Oct 9 2007, nadir Mar 9 2009 with drawdown of 55.3%, recovery by Apr 2 2012. (This was short-lived: it fell again after that day and took until Aug 16 2012 to exceed the 2007 peak again, after which it rose steadily.) 1970s crash: peak Jan 11 1973, nadir Oct 3 1974 with drawdown of 48.2%, recovery by July 17 1980 (NEEDS CORRECTION FOR TOTAL RETURN). The 2000-2002 bear market is worth mentioning as well: peak Sep 1 2000, nadir Oct 9 2002 with drawdown of 47.4%, recovery by Oct 23 2006. (There was also a peak on Mar 24 2000 with a value of 99.93% that of the peak on Sep 1. This extends the period of unrealized loss from six years and two months to six years and seven months.)

The 2000s were disappointing because the combination of two severe bear markets led to extended periods of zero return. How far can we go back and still find a higher value than the bottom of the Great Recession on Mar 9 2009? May 5 1997 — nearly 12 years. And how far forward do we need to move before we permanently exceed the peak reached on Mar 24 2000? This finally happens on Dec 21 2010, well over ten years later.

Calculations for the 2020 crash, Great Recession, and 2000-2002 bear market relied on values of the [S&P 500 total return](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5ESP500TR) from Yahoo! Finance. Using the [S&P 500 price](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EGSPC) ignores dividends and therefore understates performance. This leads to exaggeration of bear markets, especially when calculating the time between nadir and recovery to previous peak. [↩](#fn3)

<sup id="f4"> 4 </sup> How bad was the Great Depression? After a decade of roaring growth, the predecessor to the S&P 500 peaked on Sep 16 1929 and fell 86.2% by Jun 1 1932. It spent significant periods with a drawdown in excess of 80%: all days but one between Apr 8 and Aug 2 1932, and again most days between Feb 14 and Apr 7 1933. Another index, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, fell 89.2% at the nadir. [↩](#fn4)
